create a list of lists, the format should be as such: <<lemma, # of times it appears in the review>,<lemma, # of times it appears in the review>...>

loop through every word in the review 
	find out the lemma of the word
	if the lemma already exists in the list, then just add one to the # of times it appears
	else create a new entry in the list

add TF values to each individual list, the format should be as such: <<lemma, # of times, TF>,<lemma, # of times  TF>...> ... to find the TF value, divide the # of times value by the number of lemmas

loop through all the lemmas in any one of the lists of lists

	loop through all the reviews and see if each review contains the selected lemma 
		
	add an entry to each individual list regarding how many reviews contain the lemma in the list


add IDF values to each individual list ... to find the IDF value follow this formula: 20/number of reviews that contain the lemma in the list

add TF-IDF values to each individual list, to the TF-IDF value follow this formula: TF*IDF
