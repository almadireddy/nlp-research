Task Description: The goal of this task is to build a baseline system with SVM regression to predict helpfulness ratios of user-generated product reviews based on review content features. You will generate two sets of test and training files, process review text with a NLP library, and use a SVMR implementation to train and test a system. 

1. Go to http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/ and download the "Electronics" data file. From this, filter out reviews to create two sets of training and test files; one set will be unfiltered, the other must include only reviews with 10 or more votes; both sets should consist of 1000 reviews each (20 reviews from 50 products). From these two sets you will generate two sets of training and test files (80% training, 20% testing).
2. Either with spaCy or Stanford Core NLP, process reviews in all files and get the following features:
	a) Length of review in sentences
	b) Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level
	c) Spelling errors to words ratio
	d) Star rating of the product
	e) TDF-IDF statistic for all the lemmas obtained from the unigrams in the review

3. Follow the SVMLight file format to generate test and training files to predict helpfulness ratios.
4. Use the scaling tool distributed with LIBSVM to scale all values [0,1] for all files.
5. For both data sets, run SVMLight regression with default parameters, and then again with the radial basis kernel.
6. From the results, calculate RMSE and MAE for the 4 systems.
7. Write a single report based on on http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~lorenzo/teaching/cs174/Archive/Winter2015/Projects/finals/ack.pdf and https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/cse255/reports/wi15/Kristj%C3%A1n_J%C3%B3nsson_Devin_Platt.pdf.
