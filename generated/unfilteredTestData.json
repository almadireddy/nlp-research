Headphones aren't worth it if the sound does not satisfy.These *more than* satisfy.Second, the applicability to the task.The earplugs supplied with the earbuds are darn good and will work for most applications.  I decided that I wanted something even more custom, so I cut up some of my normal motorcycle-riding foam plugs and fitted them over the earphones.  The result is excellent.  Even at 80 mph I get good sound with comfort and acceptable windnoise reduction.If you want absolute noise isolation plus sound, I recommend you get large-size soft foam earplugs.  Drill out a hollow shaft through the center.  To do this, heat up a 3/32&quot; drill bit, force it through one end and then twist repeatedly to cut out a shaft.

{"reviewerID": "A7HEVWKSWUSI4", "asin": "B00001P4XA", "reviewerName": "Autistic Aaron", "helpful": [7, 7], "reviewText": "Upon determining that the Apple-brand ear pods included with my iPod were of inferior quality, I opted to have them replaced ASAP.  I assessed my options while remaining conscious of my budget and planned usage of the product, and decided on the Koss \"The Plug\" (or \"Spark Plug\") ear buds.  My other option was the Shure E2C model, as a friend owns these, and they sound phenominal.  However, since I don't foresee myself using my iPod all that often, I didn't up my budget to accommodate these.These headphones are of the \"ear bud\" style, which basically means that a foam/malleable nub is inserted into the actual canal of your ear (as opposed to ear pods, which snugly rest within the exterior of the canal.)  An important thing to know about ear bud-style headphones is that THEY WILL NOT PERFORM AT THEIR MAXIMUM ABILITY IF NOT PROPERLY INSERTED!  Instructions are clearly printed on the back of the package, and if not followed, you will NOT get the best usage out of your product -- in fact, the sound quality very well may sound terrible.To PROPERLY insert these ear buds, the ENTIRE foam nub must be fully compressed (via pinching and rolling with the fingers) and immediately inserted into the ear canal.  Additionally, your best bet is to gently pull your ear canal open by gripping the top of your ear with your thumb and index finger while inserting.  The ear buds then must be held in place (without shoving them in deeper) for approximately 8-10 seconds, while the foam expands into your ear canal, forming a solid fit.  If incorrectly inserted (i.e. not inserted all the way, not compressing the foam prior to insertion, etc.) highs and lows will sound AWFUL, even if you own a pair of $300 ear buds (yes, they do exist.)  Simply put, if you look in the mirror with the ear buds inserted and you can only see the plastic ear pod outside of your ear, then you can pat yourself on the back for a job well done.With that out of the way, the sound output of these rather inexpensive Koss ear buds is very impressive for the price.  The frequency response ranges from 10 Hz to 20 kHz, which is nothing to smirk at.  Distortion is cleverly kept to a minimum at all volume levels except for the very loudest point (I suggest breaking in your ear buds gently before hopping right in and destroying your ear drums.)  The bass output is subtle and effective for the most part, but doesn't perform very well with certain genres of music (while almost all electronic music sounds amazing, bass-heavy rock music or deep rap music may not produce the same satisfaction.)  It should also be known that there literally is no headphone, in-ear or not, that perfectly reproduces all styles of music, and this applies to even the most expensive models.  Any given headphone device will excel in certain categories of sound reproduction, while performing less impressively in others.  (Can you tell I'm an audiophile yet?)The few negativities to speak of are as follows.  The cable, while a decent length (not too short, not too long,) feels rather fragile.  Additionally, the included foam polymer ear buds are on the large side, and may or may not cause some minor to severe  discomfort after extended periods of use (upwards of an hour.)  Thankfully, replacement ear buds can be purchased in multiple sizes at most electronics stores.Overall, if you're finding yourself in the same boat I was and are looking for a suitable replacement for your disappointing Apple-brand iPod ear pods but don't want to break the bank, the Koss \"The Plug\" are HIGHLY recommended for the price.  I haven't heard any other in-ear ear buds in this price range, but I can imagine that these are hard to beat for the money.Just DON'T FORGET TO PROPERLY INSERT THEM EVERY TIME!  Once you get the hang of it, they can be properly inserted and snug in your ears within 15 seconds.  If you don't insert them correctly, they WILL NOT SOUND GOOD AT ALL, and you will have WASTED YOUR MONEY!  I'm a smoker, and even I hate wasting money!  So, educate yourself on in-ear headphones before buying any, and you won't be disappointed.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Amazing value, great sound if used PROPERLY!", "unixReviewTime": 1131494400, "reviewTime": "11 9, 2005"}

Portapros are produced all the way since the 80s and have a flimsy look. My doubts continued as I was unpacking my Portapros. Could this little, flimsy, plastic set of headphones be that good? All of my doubts have evaporated once I have tried using them. These headphones have two big pros:1. Sound quality: One thing you should be aware of is that these headphones are _loud_. I have compared them to my Sennheiser HD201 and Sony MDR-A34. There is no comparison. Portapro is much louder. Of course, if you don't like it, you can turn down the volume. However, despite the loudness, the sound is excellent. I can pick a lot of details in my music CDs that were nearly undetected with the MDR-A34 and barely audible with the HD201. When I play first person shooter games, I am getting excellent directional sound.2. Comfort: The comfort is excellent. The headphones sit very tightly on my head and yet they don't apply much pressure to my ears. I can wear my Portapros for hours without feeling any discomfort. The reason for this, is that these headphones come with extra cushions the sit above your ears and shift some pressure to your head leaving very little pressure on ears. You can also choose how much pressure you want to have applied to your ears. If the default is too much, you can shift some of that pressure to the auxiliary cushions by changing the \"Comfort Zone\"  settings (the blue buttons above the driver, it's best to start playing with them once you already wear the headphones). Since the headphones sit tight on your head, they're suitable for outdoor or gym use. The cable length is just right to reach your PC speaker or mp3 player (about 3 feet), but I suppose that some people will find it too short. Finally, the set folds easily and fits into a small leather bag provided for portability.And, have I mentioned lifetime warranty? If they ever break, just send them to Koss with a $6 check. They'll fix or replace them for you. Overall I am very satisfied and would recommend these headphones to anyone who needs cheap, reliable headphones with good sound quality for either indoor or outdoor use.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The best computer/mp3 player headphones for the money", "unixReviewTime": 1282608000, "reviewTime": "08 24, 2010"}

I bought these headphones to watch movies as I don't listen to much music. These phones have a great sound. Like others who have noted the enhanced bass, I love the bass. I view them as no-nonsense headphones. They delvier great sound but do not have the extra bells and whistles of more expensive models (as these are very reasonably priced). For example, they do not have the sound adjustment switch on the cord and the cord is coiled so you're not always dragging around cord that's continuously getting hung up on something. The only down side I have noticed is fairly peculiar to people with, how shall we say, over-sized heads. They are comfortable. The foam totally encloses the ear so that there's no sound loss or outside sound distractions. But I do have to occasionally readjust their position when listening to long movies to avoid feeling cramped. The head band does adjust but does not offer a wide range of expansion. To put this in perspective, I have a pair of PhillipsSBC HP250s that I can't wear for more than 30 minutes without getting a headache. I also have a pair of Panasonic RP-HT355S that are far more comfortable but aren't as comfortable as these.

Bose and several others qualify too.I have a bunch of very high end speakers and amplifiers rounding out at $8K for my primary system, so my ears are spoiled. See my review of AKG 702 headphones for listing of my test system and CDs. I bought the AKGs for best sound quality available for less than $1000Akg K702 Reference Class Open-Back HeadphoneMY REQUIREMENTS WERE:* Fits big noggin* Comfortable for hours of use* sounds great* less than $400* eliminates noise from dishwasher, vacuum and significant other when I am listening* For use at home in my favorite chair* No leakage so my daughter can sit next to me reading or doing her homeworkREQUIREMENTS TRANSLATED INTO FEATURES:* Over the ear cups that completely encase the ear* Adjustable headband that fits big heads, not giant* Sling configuration headbands are the best for long wearing comfort and rest on the head as opposed to clamping on the head and ears. If you move around a lot with headphones on, slings are not for you.* Closed cans, to isolate outside sounds. No leakage in or out* Long straight cable, preferably replaceableKOSS R80 REVIEWWhy R80:Same drivers as highly acclaimed Koss Porta Pro open headphones, replaceable cord, closed cans, US company made in Korea, adjustable headband, familiar name from the old days who made Audiophile quality headphones. Available straight or coiled cord.PROS* Semi sling adjustable headband* Closed cans and ear pad do eliminate leakage* Sound quality is good but not great, if the AKG 702s are a 99% of perfection, these are an 85-90%* Price, these are very affordable headphones that should last a long time* Build quality appears to be good, time is the best judge for reliability* The drivers should last forever* Replaceable ear pads and cordsCONS* Fit is good for medium and small noggins, a bit tight for my large noggin.* Closed cans and ear pads do not breath and can get very hot with a tight fit, it may be the material the ear pads are made of, possibly Koss could add some venting to the closed cans to alleviate the heat buildup*  Sound quality is good, not great; but for the price, 1 tenth of the AKGs, hard to argue with*  Sound stage is a bit narrow compared to AKG 702s and Audio Technica open and closed 700s, both 3x to 4x more money. Narrow sound stage may be a result of the closed can damping implementation and the materiel in the padsSUMMARYIn reading the other Koss reviews, if you are looking for stationary listening affordable Koss headphones, the UR40 open backs may be a very good option since they both breath and allow the drivers to move freely without damping concerns. Leakage would be a factor, but the sound stage should be bigger and heat gone.Koss UR40 Collapsible Over-Ear HeadphonesMy impression is that that from a design point of view the R80 was a good first effort by the Koss designers who should follow up by moving the R80 drivers and replaceable cord config to the R20 sling and bigger rounded ear pads configuration and offer the R80 in open and closed back cans like the AT 700. If the sling and ear pad materials on the R20 config can be significantly upgraded for a few bucks the designers should do it. Until Koss addresses the heat build up issue, they will always be at a significant disadvantage with an easily correctable problem. Koss should benchmark their Ur20, UR 40 and R80 vs the AT 700 for fit and comfort and continue to use their existing high-volume highly-acclaimed drivers.closed canClosed-back dynamic audiophile headphones, 53 mm drivers with neodymium magnet systems, 3.5 mm connector w/ 1/4\" adapteropen canAudio Technica ATH-AD700 Open-air Dynamic Audiophile Headphones with 53mm Drivers with Neodymium Magnet SystemsKoss needs to decide the target market customer for each product and clearly state the applications on their web site, commerce sites and packaging, otherwise one is left guessing what the Koss designers were thinking when they designed the unit.Simply buying the units to see what they sound like and how they fit is both expensive and time consuming. Head size recommendations would be giant plus on their web site. There must be several attractive people already working at Koss that could model their headphones on their web site with different views showing the connected equipment and applications, the cost to Koss for providing more and better photos would be $zero.  Alternatively, Koss could go all out and pay a professional photographer a few hundred for a photo shoot using Koss employees wearing the headphones and jacked into the target equipment like: i-pod, chair next to expensive stereo, next to sampling kiosk in store, sitting in an airplane pilots seat, ham radio etc.In the end, I gave the R80s to my 10 year old since her head is smaller than mine, the clamping is not as tight resulting in less heat buildup. For listening to her I-pod nano, Nintendo game and pc applications the headphones are perfect. They are her early Christmas gift. I had planned to use them with my PC but too tight and too hot, stereo and movie listening was a long shot based on the drivers that didn't work out.RECOMMENDATIONIf your head isn't big, and you are looking for some good-sounding inexpensive-headphones this might be the pair for you for all stationary applications including sitting at your work cube jacked in. Noise isolation is good. Cans don't fold and they are not echo-noise canceling so using them on the commuter train or airplane may not work.

They have great bass, nice high highs and are clear and undistorted in most of the situations in which I use them. I could go on for pages about how much I like the sound and how they sound, to me, like much more expensive headphones. They are open style, which is not in vogue now with people who are discovering high fidelity headphones for use with a portable player, but they are very practical when you want to be able to hear your surroundings.The fit is good. But the headband is awkward. It consists of a pair of tightly curved metal bands that are bound by two plastic slide clips. You push the clips together to extend the bands apart from each other, thereby expanding the space between the earpieces. The system works and feels pretty durable to me, but it is clumsy. Or I am clumsy. Either way it is unusual. But when they are on, they stay in place, and for on-the-ear style headphones, they are quite comfortable to me. They are also very light as they are very thin, not padded (except on the earpieces) and small. These are actually really good on-ear headphones for someone who wants to jump in their headphones.I think their great advantage is their sound quality. They look and feel a little flimsy, but I think they aren't as flimsy as they look. But I don't think anyone is buying these for the look, unless they are doing it ironically. The quality of sound is the star here. I don't think they sound as good as $200 headphones, but that isn't bad, considering the fact they usually sell for around $24.For identical sound (as far as I am concerned) with a simpler and less expensive headband, I suggest the Koss KTXPRO1 at about $18.

I took the drivers off the headband and put them into KSC75's ear clip (effectively making them KSC35) to see how the sound changes, and it confirmed my theory. Once off the headband, the sound signature became very similar to KSC75's with a little more bass and a little less sparkle in the high frequency range.

But after 2 months, I learned to like this headphones, and probably after it got &#34;burned&#34; for enough hours, the real sound came out and I admit that it also has deep bass.

Rivera", "helpful": [5, 5], "reviewText": "The SportaPro has a dirty little secret.The Sportaro literally uses the same exact drivers and housing as the KSC35, but instead of attaching the KSC35's clips, they attached the SportaPro headband. Here's my head-fi review 'snippet' of the KSC-35 which IS the same as the Sportapro:KSC-35, the more mature Koss clip-on that was discontinued and then brought back (only on the Koss website), for a pretty hefty $45. I'd say it's hefty because it honestly should cost just slightly above the KSC75 range, not 3x as much. They sound very similar to the KSC75. However, they are fuller sounding, with fuller bass approaching full-sized type bass, and the mids/vocals are very rich and forward. Treble is also quite neutral for me, not being too smooth, and not too sparkly. I actually am quite fond of their treble. The KSC75's treble is harsher, grainier, and more fatiguing. The mids on the KSC75 are slightly laid back, while the KSC35 presents them up front and more fleshed out. In all honesty, you can say the difference between the KSC75 and KSC35 is like the difference between the K701 and Q701. One is brighter, drier, and thinner sounding, while the other is more natural, and fleshed out.All in all, it's a solid sounding headphone, that does work very well. Bass was strong but quick due to the open nature of the headphones, but slower than the KSC75. Based on sound alone, I'd say the KSC35 is a headphone you could use for hours without fatigue. Kind of like a smaller, more bassy HD650. Nice tonal balance that I don't think anyone would dislike.The Koss Sportapro houses the same drivers as the KSC35, for less than half the price. You can literally buy the Sportapro, snap off the drivers, and snap the KSC75/35 clips on to the Sportapro drivers, and you have a cheaper KSC35. Ideal solution is getting the Sportapro and KSC75, putting the KSC75 clips onto the Sportapro drivers. This will save you $10, give you BOTH the KSC35 and KSC75 as a spare, and give the most comfort, IMHO. Just make sure to bend the KSC75 clips to place the drivers closer to the ears, as stock form may place the drivers too far, losing bass and overall sound quality.The more popular alternative, is to buy the cheap Parts express headphone (http://www.amazon.com/Mini-Stereo-Lightweight-Headphones-feet/dp/B0002KQZJS/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1371458925&sr;=1-1&keywords;=parts+express+headphones), taking off the crappy drivers, and using the headband for the Koss drivers.

And by DJ, I mean the live-performance variety, not the studio-technician variety.And, for DJs, these headphones are excellent.The actual physical configuration of the headphones is clearly designed for DJ use, with easily folding, individually rotating cups for single-side monitoring.  They are also designed to rest close to the ear which, although it may make your ears hot and uncomfortable if you use them for prolonged home listening, is ideal for DJs because they effectively cancel noise up to extremely high volumes (I've used these in both a small party and club setting, and have found the non-electronic cancellation to be more than adequate for both).The actual sound styling is typical of Sony, with the quality generally reflecting the price.  I listen to a variety of music through these: in addition to hip hop &amp; house for club use, i listen to various other electronica, various rock, lots of acoustic music and a ton of a capella.  The headphones perform admirably in all cases.  The bass is strong without being overbearing, the mids are balanced and the highs are clear without being ringy or piercing.Please note my initial admonition again, however: these headphones are designed for DJs.  For your money, you can probably find a better set for home use by Sennheiser, or similar, which aren't geared torward performance/studio use.  In addition, other reviewers are right: the headphones get uncomfortable after prolonged use (I found that after about 30 minutes to an hour of home use, I felt the need to take them off and massage my ears for a bit, as these fit tight and are a bit heavy).  The only reason I would ever recommend against these for DJs is if you plan on spinning for an extraordinarily extended period of time, because they are slightly heavier than the v600s and the extra weight, while usually unnoticable, can become an issue if you're spinning upwards of five or six hours.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "great for DJs, for whom they are intended.", "unixReviewTime": 1041984000, "reviewTime": "01 8, 2003"}

I've never had any complaints about the quality of the music playing through this. Listening to music with this is quite superb; the bass, mid-range and highs are all equally there.As for the build quality, these have definitely stood the test of time. The original fabric-like material that was surrounding the earpieces and headband have cracked and worn away--this DOES NOT affect sound quality. In fact, I think the extra material is on there to make it easy to clean when the headphones get dirty. The cord looks like the day I got it, the printing on the plastic has not worn away.The only minor issue (and this is mainly because I've read about it from others), is creaking sound when turning your head. The cause of this is the plastic twisting and bending. Again, I never really noticed it until others pointed it out.I haven't had to replace these for 13 years so gather what you will from that statement.

The MDR-V6 is the one that is comparable to the mdr-7506, NOT the v600. If you are not familiar with the MDR line, I can understand how easy it is to confuse the model numbers. I own the V6 and my brother owns the MDR-7506 and i have directly compared these and found that are identical physically from what I can tell aesthetically and both have near identical sound. The MDR-V600 can be described as the black sheep in the family, since it looks, feels, and sounds very different than its more accomplished siblings.The MDR-v600 is much bigger and bulkier than both the V6 and the mdr-7502. While it uses similar drivers, It has a huge earcup and large foam paddings that color the sound. Most noticeable is overbearing amount of bass this thing gives out, which drowns out the mids. This would account for some of muddiness that other reviewers have described. So how this headphone got to be called studio monitors is beyond me. This headphone is more like a pair of v6 that was modified to meet the mainstream demands of bassheads. Whereas v6 was half metal/half plastic, the v600 is all plastic. On the plus side, the huge earcups do help isolate sound a little better than the V6/7502.If you want accurate sound that you can actually use as monitors, stick with the tried and true Sony models such as the v6 or 7502.

The headphones are completely over the ears, so that took some time to get used to as well because that can also cause a little pain initially as well; I've also gotten used to this. One other problem is the adapter, the 3.5mm adapter is massive and sticks out of my computer like 2-2.5\" so it's nearly impossible to use it with the computer at an incline (ie: on a laptop chill pad, or even watching it on your lap).Even with this all said it's still the best pair of headphones I've owned and it seems like it'll continue providing quality sound for many years to come.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Quality!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1350777600, "reviewTime": "10 21, 2012"}
