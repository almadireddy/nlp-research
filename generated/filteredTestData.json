I didn't do any research on this camera at all but it has turned out to be even better than my Olympus 5060 or my old Canon G2. The things I really love about this camera are:1) The zoom, wow, got some great pictures of whales and glaciers on an Alaska cruise! You just can't beat 12X optical zoom :)2) Really fast! I've had a series of digital cameras including Canon G2, Olympus 5060 etc and this is by far the fastest of the bunch. On all the others there was a noticeable processing time delay; on this camera it almost always snaps the shot right away!3) The same LCD I came to love on the G2 that flips out and twirls around. This is invaluable for getting good shots with the camera above your head, I often use it when taking pictures of my food for website restaurant reviews.4) Great video settings, you can really take some high res quality video footage if you have enough memory!In addition, the menus are easy to use and things like picture resolution settings are very easy to access (as opposed to being buried in the menu system somewhere!). I find that 5MP is plenty for my web pictures and I think for most people it is perfectly adequate. Downloading pictures is very easy via the supplied USB cable, doesn't seem to require a special driver the way my old G2 did.The things I don't love so much:1) The camera is a bit on the bulky side; but then so were my other cameras so I'm used to that. At least it is pretty lightweight for its size.2) I'm not such a big fan of the flip out flash, several times I take a nighttime photo and wonder why the flash didn't go off! Just takes getting used to; at least its easy to turn off the flash if you don't want it!3) Where is the high speed/sports setting on the dial? If you want to take high speed shots you will have to dig into the menu system.Overall, this is the best camera I've ever owned of the 5 previous digital cameras; I'm a happy camper :)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Love that zoom!

Earlier I used to slip my camera in my pocket even when walking the dog as you never knew when you got a good photo opportunity. And my older cameras always fitted into my handbag so I was never without a camera.

Earlier I used to take almost 60-70 shots a week and now it's just during some weekends or vacations. For instance, carrying the S2 on a date seems rather \"geeky\" and you can never carry it unobstrusively. So even though I love the versatility of the S2 I'll have to spend another $300+ to buy the digital elph.

I bought my previous digital camera five years ago but at 2.1 Mp it was past its use-by date.  An upgrade was in order.  After a bit of research - not much - the Canon S2 IS was my choice.  I wanted mega-zoom with image stabilisation, reasonable compactness, and 5+ megapixels.  In the wedding industry, where I have my business,  professional photographers almost universally use Canon digital SLRs so it looked to me that Canon's picture quality and in-camera processing were likely to be superior.I bicycle around Melbourne a lot and a pocket-sized 6-8 Mp camera would be convenient, but that 12x zoom trumps that, even though I have to backpack the camera.  Five megapixels is enough given the sizes I work in - up to A4 - and the zoom means cropping is minimised.Features I like.I won't rehash previous reviewers' comments.  I like the panorama function.  This is much easier to use than that on my old digicam (which required a tripod for alignment) and the Canon PC software does a good job of stitching shots together.  It can do vertical and horizontal pans, or mixtures of the two.  I can retire my 21mm Rokkor now.  The other day I took hand-held multi-shot pans indoors in a sports stadium.  The indicated shutter speed was 1/16 yet the results are good given the difficult conditions.The two-speed zoom is effective and easy to control.  The slow speed makes it easy to frame a shot, and the high speed gets from maximum zoom to wide-angle fast.Shortcomings.I have noticed the problem with focus in low-light even with the focus assist light on.  Sometimes - not always - the camera can't find the focus.  It seems it needs a definite edge to focus on.  Having seen professionals move their cameras slightly to find a focus point I suspect the Canon is no worse than others. I can live with it.A case is not supplied.  Canon is keeping the purchase price down I suppose, but all the same you do need a case.  The official Canon case is ridiculously expense.The lens cap is a slip-on type and is not as secure as one that grips a filter thread, but it's bearable.The small capacity SD card supplied is a cost-cutter and must be augmented immediately.The electronic viewfinder is not as easy to use as an optical viewfinder in daylight, but is better than optical in dim light and displays comprehensive picture information.  The LCD display is small but this is more than offset by the convenience of the swivelling feature.  The latter is great for taking pictures holding the camera over one's head.Lack of a hotshoe flash or sync socket. A strange, and major, omission which dowgrades the camera advanced amateur level to serious amateur level. It will take an expensive Canon-brand (radio sync) flash fitted to an accessory bar but I can't use my high-power zoom flash. This was off-putting but I decided I could live with it as I don't do much photography that requires higher power than than the built-in flash.  And the built in flash is reasonably powerful.It's difficult to give an objective assessment having spent the money - cognitive dissonance and all that - but I certainly don't regret the purchase.

When recording video and you need to zoom in and out, the sound of the zoom motor is noticeable in quiet environment and will be recorded into your clip. However, if there is some background sounds, it would not be a problem at all.4. If you use alkaline batteries, you can take only about 130 shots before the batteries drain out. But using NiMH batteries, you can take up to 550 shots on one charge.5. The nature length of the lens makes the build-in flash is useless when you want to take some super-macro (new feature) picture where the object is less than an inch from the lens. In this case, you probably need an external flash.6. Using macro focus (not super-macro) will give you some distortion. It's better to use telephoto macro.7.

I know this sounds very obvious, but not everyone does this (me, being one of those people.)We found that the shutter is MUCH FASTER than my Sony DSCP10 Cyber-shot.  MUCH faster.  My Sony is s-l-o-w to take a picture; whereas the Canon focuses, computes and takes the picture in under a second.  My Sony could take up to 5 seconds!  The Canon's responsiveness is very close to that of a normal 35mm film camera (SLR.)  This could be a big deal if you are taking pictures of quick cats or slippery kids, or anything else that is good at dodging the camera.The overall feel of camera is solid and lasting.  I have my doubts that if I dropped this on cement that the lens and body will be able to take the blow, but I have yet found a reason to test this out and haven't had the opportunity to do so accidentally.  The buttons feel good, should survive some repeated use and are well-placed.  Maybe with the exception of the shutter button: I found it a little difficult to hold the camera with one hand while pointing it at me and my wife (you know, the obligatory self-portrait-picture-taking when no one is around to do it for you.)  The shutter button is on the top-front of the camera and I found it hard to get my finger on it AND hold it.  No biggie, just noticed it.However, we noticed that a finger on our left hand covered the Auto-Focus lens when gripping the camera in a natural manner.  I also noticed that it wasn't just us; I witnessed a couple hand this very same camera to a stranger to take their picture and she immediately placed her finger over the Auto-Focus lens.  Why does this matter?  The camera sends out a beam to judge the distance and focus the lens - cover it and the camera can't focus properly.  The viewing screen is small enough that you might not notice the out of focus picture until you get home.Another issue: pictures look BEAUTIFUL on the little flip-out screen, but when downloaded we saw that some looked very much out of focus (operator error, not the camera.)  Point: the little screen makes all of the pictures look good, so take two or more shots to be sure!YOU MUST BUY RECHARGABLE BATTERIES!  You paid enough for the camera, so you pay hundreds more in batteries??  This camera needs four (4) AA batteries, and can go through them by the time you fill up a 1 GB card.  The little flip-out screen will consume your batteries' life, so I HIGHLY recommend two sets of four 2500 mAh AA rechargeable batteries that you can rotate through.  (You will thank me after you get half-way through your day and your regular batteries are dead.)A really cool feature is the Diopter Adjustment.  This will be VERY beneficial for those that wear glasses but DON'T wear them while looking through the view finder (some of us don't always use the little flip-out screen.)  You can dial in an adjustment so that the display information will appear clearly.  There are many LITTLE icons around the edges of the viewing area in the view finder, and if you can't see them or your subjects clearly because you have taken off your glasses then your picture taking will suffer.The pictures we have taken with this Powershot are crispy, clear and close to life-like color (which means less PhotoShopping later.)  BUT! you must configure your camera's \"SCN\" (Special Scene Mode) to match your environment in order to take great pictures!

Why? It's smaller, easier to carry, has the extended zoom range, and uses AA batteries. It's better to have a camera that you'll actually take with you, than one that takes great photos but is awkward to travel with or carry so it stays at home.While everyone goes on about how great the image stabilizer is with the long lense, (which is is) it also shines when you're in a low light situation, like a museum, where you can't use flash. I have a great collection of art photos from museums around the country that I could have never taken with one of our Nikon D70s without a tripod.The only limitations I find in the S2 is that it doesn't have an especially wide angle view, but none of the \"ultra-zoom\" cameras do, so it's not something you can fault it for.For low light, another stop in the ISO (from 400 to 800) would be nice, which Canon has put on the S3, so if you want that feature you can get it.While the camera will do most anything in manual and specialized modes, you don't have to know anything about cameras to get good pictures, and I've handed it to a half-dozen novices to use for the day and they've all come back with good shots.I've had many brands of digital cameras, Olympus, Fuji, Sony, Nikon, and Casio, and for point and shoots, Canon just does it right.

I got the 52mm lensmate adapter, a Raynox 6600 0.66x wide adapter, and UV and circular polarizer filters.

W/ the filters, I can get the polarization & everything else I was used to on my SLR. My total gear pack weighs about half of what I was used to when lugging everything for a hike. A very positive change indeed.The only two things missing from this camera are the ability to shoot RAW images, and a hot shoe or PC connector for better lighting control. Canon sells a rig w/ a slave flash on it, seems o.k. but there's no way to do true off-camera lighting w/ this machine.Overall, I think this camera is everything a serious amater needs as long as you're not doing a lot of portrait work w/ sophisticated lighting. And since the S3 IS is shipping in another month, with very limited upgrades (1MP larger images, that's about it), the price is really dropping on the S2. This represents a fantastic value for a high-end digital.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great camera, super value, and expandable", "unixReviewTime": 1144800000, "reviewTime": "04 12, 2006"}

You all know the jist of this new ipod: it plays music, videos, and displays pictures all done in full color with style! The other reviewers on this page certainly have a knack for telling you the rundown of what this mp3 player can do. I have myself owned 3 ipods (including this one) in the last 7 months. Why? We'll get to that in a second.Anyway, if you were thinking about getting an mp3 player but you dont want to buy this one becausea) ill never fill the damn thing!b) its just too expensive andc) everyone's got one and I dont want to look like everyone elsewell i have a few reasons why you should. To counter my last statements chronologically:1) you need room for expansion and your ever-changing tastes not to mention the \"leave me by the side of the road\" trends of technology. In other words, you cant predict the future.2) dont be cheap. seriously, good technology (like this) comes at a price and you may spend less for another player but you certainly WILL get less. To summarize, just open a bank account and save! its what they're for. And finally3) Come on! you know as well as I thats a stupid reason not to get one of these. Give me an excuse that \"the sound quality is just not good enough\" or \"ill never use it\" and Ill accept that. Dont say you dont want to get it just to fight the undertow of popular culture. In short, there's a reason why everyone's got one of these just like there's a reason everyone's got a honda; it just flat does what its supposed to.Now, some of you might not like some of what I'm about to say next. Thats fine. Keep in mind that this is my opinion and you know as well as I if you were thinking about getting one of these (or not) you will do what you want no matter how many bad or good things I say about it.Now that that's out of the way, on to my review.To summarize bluntly, this is the best ipod ever made in every single way including sound quality. You may have liked your old ipod but by god this one is like comparing a ford escort to a lexus ls430; its just better and beefier in every single way.Well, I have to say that the photo aspect of the video is just like a regular ol' photo. It displays pictures. whoopty doo. unless your a major photophile, this aspect probably wont intersest you enough to buy it just for this feature.The video aspect is certainly a refreshing and sort of strange addition to this new device. I say its strange because if you think about it, by definition an mp3 player is designed to play music and only music. The addition of video turns this device into something else which doesnt really have a name yet. Maybe we can call it \"multimedia device\" for now and leave it at that. The screen is really still too small for this sort of feature, even considering this is the largest ipod screen ever. The screen is plenty crisp by the way and displays videos nicely.For music this is probably the best mp3 ever made up til now: It's got plenty of room, its small (but not too small), the sound quality is superb and is free from distortion in the high frequencies (which is why I abandoned my old ipod photo 60GB. the distortion is inherent in all photo ipods), and its compatible with most computers out there.Now that Ive basically turned the ipod into the holy grail, its not without flaws.The video aspect is great but unfortunately if you want to watch videos in good quality, you must watch it in \"widscreen\" which further reduces the viewing area. You can turn off the widescreen but it severely cuts off the sides of the picture and degrades quality. Annoying, but this feature can be fixed with future updates and a standardization of resolution for videos played on the ipod. And also, the battery life for watching videos really just bites. You get 2-3 hours. Part of this has to do with the huge size of some videos and also the fact that the backlight stays on when watching videos. Again, some standardizing will help this. In addition, you can watch ANY video on your ipod, but you must convert it to a format that the player can understand. You can do this with quicktime pro, but it takes FOREVER. I'm sure there are other ways to do it which dont cost any money, but i have QTP so I didnt look into this.Music is played back with refreshing clarity and crispness that has been lacking in all ipods up to this point. Even if you arent an audiophile, you will hear the difference. Unfortunately, with these new ipods, apple has decided that everyone has usb 2.0 on their computers and has abandoned firewire. Most people who buy ipods are windows users, but I'm a mac user and the lack of firewire basically kills this purchase for me. Most people wont care, but for those who do, be warned.Finally, to explain why this is my 3rd ipod purchase: crappy sound quality, and I dont mean from compression artifacts. All and I mean all photo ipods have a distortion which can be heard on music which is abundant in high frequencies and has plenty of audio \"space,\" like a piano solo. Check out my review of the 60 GB ipod to get more details. Fortunately, the video does not have this problem.So, there you have it. This is a great player in every way. All the flaws that the player has with playing video can be fixed with a software update which will come once more people have the player. The battery life is VERY good with the exception of playing videos, and the SQ for music is the best of any mp3 player Ive ever heard. Once more standardization comes along, we will all be watching episodes of \"smallville\" on the metro ride to work. I give this player 4 and 1/2 stars for the lack of firewire because that is an important feature which I think should have been included.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "So close to perfect!", "unixReviewTime": 1131408000, "reviewTime": "11 8, 2005"}

I had a lot of doubts and worries about it as I have strict guidelines for electronics, but those are all gone now.The Good:- Assuming you encode your movies correctly, video playback is awesome.  The quality all depends on the movies you have.  I have a lot of HDTV 24 episodes and they look just like they do on my computer monitor.  IF YOU ENCODE INCORRECTLY THEY WILL NOT PERFORM WELL.-  Sound is gorgeous.  Even with those earbuds (which any real audiophile should replace anyway), the music sounds great.  There are also about 25 presets in the EQ you can choose from like Electronic, Dance, Classical, and so on.  Depending on the properties of your music, the Ipod can go pretty loud and still remain distortion-free.  Again, this depends on YOUR music files and NOT the Ipod.- Screen.  I think it could be a bit bigger, but it does the job well.  Mine is scratch free as I left the protective film it ships with on and just put a silicone case over top of that.  The plastic is a bit scratched up, but the screen underneath is fine.  Common sense would tell anyone to leave that protective film ON the device and not to pick at it or it will come off.- Options.  There are a lot of things that can be manipulated and changed.  Menus, back-light, clicker, etc.  There are also a few games like Music Quiz, where it plays a few seconds of one of your songs and you have to choose the right one out of 5 or so choices.  And, there is a diagnostic menu to test the performance of your Ipod in all areas.  Really cool.- Battery Life.  I put this in the good since it performs as I would expect.  Who is the dummy that actually mentioned 75 hours of battery life?  During video playback, the most you will get is 2.5 hours of battery life.  Let me say that again for those who lack common sense.  YOU GET 2.5 HOURS OF BATTERY LIFE DURING VIDEO PLAYBACK.  The more you use the back-light while listening to music, the less battery life you will have.  75 hours applies to never touching the thing and just letting it go through your music.  Even then, I doubt you will get 75 hours.Also, you MUST follow the instructions when first charging it.  Portable batteries are VERY sensitive to charge cycles.  If you don't charge it like you should, your battery is gonna suck.  It is HIGHLY recommended that you DO NOT let the battery life decrease past half.  There are a number of cycles for each battery and the objective is to avoid ever using an entire cycle.The Bad:- This is a hard drive based MP3 player so every so often it takes about a second longer to skip to the next track.  If this bothers you, you need a Flash memory MP3 player.- Battery life again.  Expectations aren't everything.  The next model really needs an upgraded battery.  Charging this thing constantly if you watch movies is a real pain.  It could be so much better and I feel that Apple really cut corners with the battery.- Scratches.  It does happen if you are stupid enough to walk around without a case.  THE IPOD NEEDS A CASE.  Any portable gadget needs a case.  Technology has been around long enough for people to know this.  There is no excuse.- Having to encode movies.  Why can't Itunes do that?  This was another bad choice for Apple unless they are catering to geeks only, which is fine by me.  Seriously, if you are not that computer savvy then this is not the video player for you.  You need to have an understanding of audio/video compression to get the most out of this player.Apple doesn't even have a program to encode muxed files, which a lot of internet content are.  I highly recommend everyone to 'acquire' Nero Digital from Nero 6.  It is the best converter out there at the moment that negates any sync problems.  ImToo and Videora are completely useless and make very poor files.- No wireless.  Right now, wireless headphones for the Ipod Video are practically non-existent.  Logitech seems to be trying to alleviate that, but their headphones are currently riddled with manufacturer defects and don't even support the Video.  Let's move it along Apple.  We need wireless.- Earbuds.  For the first few months, they are fantastic.  But, eventually they seem to adopt vibration problems and hearing a rattle in my right ear is REALLY annoying.All in all, it is the best MP3 player on the market right now.  Period.  There just isn't enough support for it from Apple or anyone else.  Vehicles are just now coming Ipod ready and that is limited to certain models.  Where is our support?  Apple?  Anyone?", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Nice little gadget!", "unixReviewTime": 1144108800, "reviewTime": "04 4, 2006"}

This isn't a video player indeed but, an iPod that finally has video capabilities, come on, who doesn't want to buy that? There are two colors available for it, black and white, just like the iPod nano. People have noticed that this iPod looks a little wider than the original iPod but it's not true. The dimensions for the new iPod are 4.1\" x 2.4\" x .4\" and the dimensions for the original iPod are 4.1\" x 2.1\" x .57\".

The video option has no appeal for me, as I cannot imagine watching a TV show on the small screen, and there are few music videos that I would give more than one viewing to. As such, my review of this is based strictly on music playback performance on the 30 GB model.Pros:1) Better battery life. This is a big deal for me, as I am always out and about, with music being an important part of everyday life. My mini could manage a maximum of 4 hours, and that's with minimal song skipping. The new iPod Video certainly performs much better. Without using the backlight, the high EQ setting, and skipping songs as I please, I have managed to get an average of 10 to 12 hours out of it.2) Larger capacity. I am a massive music fan, so I am pleased to have room for over 7,500 songs to have and enjoy while I'm on the go.3) Better screen. While it can be a little hard if you have the backlight turned off, I find the screen to be a vast improvement over the monochrome display screens on the older generations. The colors are rich and vibrant, and the blacks and browns are as sharp as you would expect from a computer screen.4) Sound quality remains strong. I have noticed little difference between the sound quality on my iPod mini and the iPod video, except that the latter has slightly less distortion when songs are played at high volume.5) Intuitive menu system. The menus are as easy to navigate as they are on the older generations, with slight improvements on the fonts and color scheme.6) Slimmer design. This helps to avoid the telltale bulge that the older, thicker iPods seemed to cause.7) It's eye-candy. Let's face it, iPods are becoming a fashion accessory. The black one in particular is attractive.Cons:1) The only \"extras\" included are the USB 2.0 cable, the earphones, and on more recent models shipped, a slipcase that will keep the iPod free of scratches and smudges...for a short while (see below.) Others items, like the belt clip, the firewire cable, and the wall adapter are not included.2) The shiny plastic finish attracts and alarming amount of fingerprints, smudges, and scratches, especially on the black models. The semi-soft slipcase will only go so far in protecting the iPod, so a proper case is recommended.3) The \"smart jack\" has been removed! If you don't know the term, this is the small plug that existed next to the headphone jack on all older models. This means if you were using the remote control, iTrip, car kit, or other peripheral item, it will not work on this model.4) No Firewire support. The fifth generation no longer supports transferring songs via Firewire, however you can still use the cable to charge the iPod if you are using the wall plug adapter.5) There is an occasional delay you might encounter when skipping songs, as the iPod is processing a large amount of data at one time, and this lasts for about 3 seconds. I have heard other say that the menus sometimes freeze up, but I have never encountered this.6) The battery is apparently soldered onto the motherboard, so if you are considering doing a battery replacement yourself at some point, it may not be possible.Considering the value in terms of price and wealth of space, the new iPod video has been a good investment. I am still in the honeymoon period with it, having only had it for about 2 months, but the performance has so far been excellent.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A sound investment for anyone needing a new iPod.", "unixReviewTime": 1149379200, "reviewTime": "06 4, 2006"}

When I finally relented and bought this product, I immediately began to wonder how I ever lived without it.  I have over 400 CDs, and took the time (and it did take a lot of time) to put the stuff I wanted from each of them.  The result is that I have my entire music collection at my fingertips at all times, and have not used even 20% of the memory.The obvious great feature (in terms of music, at least) of the 30 GB iPod is the ease at which you can listen to any or all of your favorite music.  One very nice, sometimes overlooked, aspect of the iPod is the shuffle feature.  With over 1500 songs on my iPod, I can hit the shuffle button and I instantly have the equivalent of my own radio station, with the added advantages of having NO songs I don't like and having zero commercials.  The shuffle does not seem to be completely random (I tend to get several songs from the same artists in a relatively short period of time), but that is a minor problem.Given the iPod's thin design and portability, you can take it wherever you go.

The key word here is evolution, as, for the most part, it only includes a few minor improvements from the previous 4th generation iPod. Read on, and I'll tell you exactly what I think of this hot new product.InstallingInstalling the iPod, I decided to just plug it into my computer. Unfortunately, the iPod locked up! That seemed pretty bad to me. After browsing the web a while, I figured out how to reboot the frozen iPod (hold down the middle select button and the menu button at the same time for about 6 seconds to reset/reboot it). Also, make sure that the iPod hold switch is not set when you try to reboot it. After rebooting, I decided to upgrade my iTunes from 6.0 to the most current version at the time (6.0.1.3) just to be safe, and then plugged in the iPod again, and it worked this time.DesignThe 5G iPod has the same classic iPod look of the 4th generation design. From a design standpoint, it is gorgeous, the same width and height as the 1st generation iPod, but about half the thickness. It has a classy and classic design that looks beautiful and elegant. In the hand it feels nice- moderate weight but solid. One thing that you'll notice is how minimalist the design is- there are very few buttons and knobs and switches. The most notable thing is its round touch wheel which has 4 buttons embedded on it and a button in the center. The 4 clickwheel buttons have a nice tactile feedback when you push on them, however, they are completely flat on the touch wheel. In fact, it's so minimalist that there is not even an on/off switch (you have to hold the pause button down for several seconds and then flip the hold switch). There is no volume knob- you use the touch wheel (which also serves also to scroll through songs and also for rating your songs). Sadly, the latest touchwheel is a downgrade from all previous versions. It is much more \"twitchy\", and error-prone than the one on my second generation iPod mini, and much inferior to my 1st generation mechanical wheel in feel and accuracy.The LCD screen is color and it's beautiful. It is 2.5\" diagonal and has a resolution of 320x240. Videos look good on the screen. Motion is clear and smooth, though the screen is really too small to watch long movies on. On the top edge, there is one headphone jack and a hold switch. On the bottom, there's a custom connector which you can use a cable to connect to your computer's USB port (Firewire is no longer supported). No docking station is included, a money-saving tactic on Apple's part.I Call It ScratchyThe 5G iPod has a very scratch-prone screen. In fact, after just 1 day of using it gently, and putting it in my pocket (without any metal objects or coins) it somehow developed far more scratches than my 3 month old 2G iPod mini which was not babied at all. In fact, it's rather upsetting that the screen in some parts is so marred with scratches that it causes video playback to sometimes shimmer in that area. At least Apple now includes a new ultra-thin neoprene-like case. I like the case a lot, it's very simple but compact and provides just enough protection for carrying around without adding much bulk.FeaturesThe iPod is fairly light on features. It plays music files in AAC format (used by Apple's iTunes music store) and plays MP3s and Apple Lossless format. Apple has finally added reasonable recording support (though you need to buy a separate add-on microphone). And, the big news is, Apple's video support. Actually, video support is pretty good. Apple's web site says it supports H.264 video at 320x240 resolution at up to 768 kbits/second, or MPEG-4 resolutions of up to 480x480, and 2.5Mbits/second but. The MPEG-4 video size limit is slightly misleading, as it in reality supports resolutions that have up to 480x480=230,400 pixels. That means with a normal 1.33 aspect ratio, it can actually do up to 554x415 pixels (good for output to a TV, the built-in screen is 320x240 and downsizes the video shown to fit the built-in screen). Note, using higher resolutions increases file sizes significantly and could severely decrease battery life because of the increased computation power needed. Other reasonable resolutions for a 1.33 aspect ratio are 512x384 or 480x360. I've decided to standardize my video content on 480x360 at 1.5Mbits/sec. as a reasonable compromise in terms of quality and space.Photo viewing on the 2.5\" screen is very nice. However, Apple left out the most important feature, being able to zoom in on the details of an image. Even my obsolete 3 year old digital camera could do that. Also, the iPod doesn't support viewing RAW photo file formats.There is still no FM radio, there is no bluetooth wireless connectivity built in (you can buy extra 3rd party addons for bluetooth, but really, it should be built in), there is no 3rd party software support for applications to run on the iPod. I hope they'll correct these deficiencies soon. There are a few extras like an alarm clock which which is practically useless because the built-in speaker is so weak, and there are a couple of games that aren't very good.Other extras include a contact manager, a calendar, and the ability to show text notes.A recently added feature is support for Podcasts. Podcasts have their own menu and also are bookmarked if you switch to something else in the middle of listening to one. Also, a dot appears next to podcasts that have not yet been listened to (a nice touch). Happily, smart playlists work correctly (if you set the star ratings for a song for instance, it will dynamically get updated on the iPod without having to re-sync with the computer). This feature had been broken by Apple for my 2nd generation mini with Firmware version 1.3.In UseWith all this talk about design and features, we shouldn't forget, it's all about the audio. My opinion is, the iPod's audio quality is very good. Audio is clear and clean. It seems to be an improvement on the iPod Mini I own, as it doesn't seem to have audio glitches when switching tracks. I'm not an audiophile, so you may want to check for yourself if you're particularly picky. Overall, I'm happy with the audio quality.Where the iPod really shines is on the software side. iTunes integration is fantastic. Keeping your music in sync between the computer and the iPod works really well. iTunes is great at managing your music, if you are willing to give it full control over organizing your music- I fought this for a while, but in the end gave in as it's just easier to let it manage and consolidate your collection. It has nice little features like finding duplicate songs so you can clean up your collection. The iTunes user interface and functionality is excellent.Playlist management in iTunes is fantastic. It is easy to create playlists and rearrange music within playlists. In addition, playlist management is very good on the iPod itself as well. Smart playlists are playlists that dynamically get updated (for instance, you can have a playlist of all 5 star rated songs, or of the most recent songs you've downloaded). You can create on-the-go playlists on the iPod directly, which is one feature I really love.This 30GB 5G iPod I own is advertised as having an 14 hour battery life, or 2 hours for video. The iPod battery is also not easily replaceable, so you can't just switch batteries when it runs out, instead, you have to recharge the iPod. Your battery results may vary. (Come back later for a full report on battery life!)Video content is now available on iTunes. However, the quality and the restrictions are a joke. You pay $1.99 for video content (such as music videos, or TV shows) but you get poor quality 320x240 resolution videos that you can NOT burn to DVD. Low quality and severe restrictions, together with a lack of much content to begin with is a disappointment.Trouble in paradise:There is a very dark side to using the iPod and iTunes, however. Apple has been very consumer unfriendly by refusing to let iTunes protected AAC format music to interoperate with other software and other MP3 players. You can not play music purchased on iTunes using any other MP3 player on the market. Although you can burn the music onto CD and then rip it again, that is a rather annoying and time-consuming barrier. Furthermore, if you purchase music from any other online store such as Real's or one that supports WMF, you can not play it in the iPod. In fact Apple has threatened to sue Real for making their music files playable on the iPod. This level of anti-consumer monopolistic behavior is beyond comprehension, for a company that has so much going for it. They basically lock you into their system and keep you there through incredibly anti-consumer practices. There is no excuse for Apple's monopolistic behavior and consumer unfriendliness here. They have a good product that stand on its own merits.A Note on iTunes Encoding Sound Quality:When ripping songs from your CDs, you need to think about what sound quality you will be happy with. The audio encoder and quality settings are found in the iTunes Preferences (under the Edit menu --> Preferences), and select the \"Importing\" tab. The general consensus is, the high quality 128K bps AAC setting is adequate for most purposes, though definitely not CD quality. In general it's a lot of trouble importing your entire CD collection into iTunes, so, I recommend picking a higher bit rate AAC encoding to get higher quality (select the \"Custom\" option). I experimented with MP3 encoding and it seems to be produce poorer quality audio in iTunes. I ended up choosing the AAC Encoder at 192 Kbps, which is a reasonable compromise in terms of space usage and audio quality. At this quality level, all but the most serious audiophiles should be satisfied. See A Report on Apple's iTunes AAC Compared to CD. See also the iPod Audio Page for more details on audio quality.CONCLUSION:The iPod 5G is an excellent music player, though still missing some important features. It has style and design that's unmatched, and works well with Apple's outstanding iTunes software. It is functional and works well for what it was designed for. Features are lacking, certainly lagging behind the competition, and you get locked in Apple's system, so that's a tradeoff you will have to weigh. I like my 5G iPod video edition, and plan to keep it at least until the next generation comes out", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "I like it...", "unixReviewTime": 1132531200, "reviewTime": "11 21, 2005"}
{"reviewerID": "A272P62Q6UEDQ0", "asin": "B000A3WS84", "reviewerName": "David Rosado", "helpful": [12, 13], "reviewText": "First, let me say that I've owned 2 other mp3 players for on the go.  First was the Dell DJ, then the iAudio X5.  The Dell lacked in the sound quality department, while the X5 excelled, especially with all the options it has.  If you want to very much customize the way your music sounds, then stop reading.  If you don't care for said options and prefer to listen to your music naturally and would like to watch superb-quality video, then by all means, read on:This isn't to say that the ipod doesn't have ways to customize the way your music sounds either.  It has about 15 EQ presets, but unfortunately that's what they remain: presets.  Myself, I don't use the EQ at all anyway, and with a good pair of earphones (click to see all my reviews to see an incredible pair for this machine) you'll be in sound paradise.Itunes:  Perhaps the easiest way to manage your music as far as I'm concerned.  The program does everything FOR you, organizing your music collection on the ipod AND PC.  Simply great, I haven't seen any problems with it yet.Interface:  Very, very simple, user-friendly UI.  Most people have used or at least seen an ipod at this point, so I don't need to go into the nitty-gritty here.  Everything is organized by id3 tag, meaning by artist, album, genre, you name it.  The only difference between this UI and other ipods is of course, the \"videos\" menu located in the main menu.Video quality:  In a word, wow.  I've owned the iaudio X5 and the video on that was passable at best.  A tiny screen, 15 fps...it was lacking.  On the ipod however, you get twice as many frames on a much clearer, larger, and color-filled screen.  The animation is fluid, the sound quality in videos is superb, and no, watching videos and this particular relatively small screen does not hurt my eyes.  I've watched MANY a TV show on here and enjoyed it thoroughly.Build quality:  Ok, here's one of the caveats that I mentioned.  I'm going to be frank:  You need to BABY this thing.  It scratches like it's been attacked by about 8 cats.  9.  9 cats.  However, if you can pluck down the 300 dollars to buy this puppy, would it not make sense to throw another 20 or so down on a decent case?  Please do yourself a favor and buy a case, as you will notice fine scratches on the back within minutes (Yes, minutes) of using it if you use the standard leather case.  Some may argue that it's a bad marketing move on Apple's part to build something so easy to scratch and not include a decent protective case, and I couldn't argue with said some.Battery life: Second caveat.  Well, sort of.  If you're listening to music, as long as you don't constantly use the backlight, EQ, Sound Check, or skip songs, you'll get a good amount of battery life out of this thing.  I've never done an \"official\" measure of it, but I'd guess 12 hours at about 75% volume.  Video, however, saps the battery life like nothing else.  You might as well only leave 2 episodes of television of it at a time, or perhaps one movie, because that's all you're going to be able to watch before seeing a red battery icon.  I guess it's a sacrafice we make to embrace a thinner form factor.And finally style:  This will be my shortest paragraph.  This thing looks, dare I say, sexy.  Sexy sexy sexy.  It's thin, flat, looks incredibly sleek...I don't know what else to say here.Consider all before making your purchasing decision.  If you're not one to take good care of your investments, then it's probably a good idea you pass this up.  However, if you want to enjoy the perks of itunes, its music store, incredibly video and great sound quality, then by all means, get yourself this ipod!P.S.  If you need a charger, might I recommend you search Amazon for a third party model and save yourself 20 dollars off the apple model!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Fantastic little device--a couple of caveats", "unixReviewTime": 1140566400, "reviewTime": "02 22, 2006"}

I had a lot of doubts and worries about it as I have strict guidelines for electronics, but those are all gone now.The Good:- Assuming you encode your movies correctly, video playback is awesome. The quality all depends on the movies you have. I have a lot of HDTV 24 episodes and they look just like they do on my computer monitor. IF YOU ENCODE INCORRECTLY THEY WILL NOT PERFORM WELL.- Sound is gorgeous. Even with those earbuds (which any real audiophile should replace anyway), the music sounds great. There are also about 25 presets in the EQ you can choose from like Electronic, Dance, Classical, and so on. Depending on the properties of your music, the Ipod can go pretty loud and still remain distortion-free. Again, this depends on YOUR music files and NOT the Ipod.- Screen. I think it could be a bit bigger, but it does the job well. Mine is scratch free as I left the protective film it ships with on and just put a silicone case over top of that. The plastic is a bit scratched up, but the screen underneath is fine. Common sense would tell anyone to leave that protective film ON the device and not to pick at it or it will come off.- Options. There are a lot of things that can be manipulated and changed. Menus, back-light, clicker, etc. There are also a few games like Music Quiz, where it plays a few seconds of one of your songs and you have to choose the right one out of 5 or so choices. And, there is a diagnostic menu to test the performance of your Ipod in all areas. Really cool.- Battery Life. I put this in the good since it performs as I would expect. Who is the moron that actually mentioned 75 hours of battery life? During video playback, the most you will get is 2.5 hours of battery life. Let me say that again for those who don't comprehend well. YOU GET 2.5 HOURS OF BATTERY LIFE DURING VIDEO PLAYBACK. The more you use the back-light while listening to music, the less battery life you will have. 75 hours applies to never touching the thing and just letting it go through your music. Even then, I doubt you will get 75 hours.Also, you MUST follow the instructions when first charging it. Portable batteries are VERY sensitive to charge cycles. If you don't charge it like you should, your battery is gonna suck. It is HIGHLY recommended that you DO NOT let the battery life decrease past half. There are a number of cycles for each battery and the objective is to avoid ever using an entire cycle.The Bad:- This is a hard drive based MP3 player so every so often it takes about a second longer to skip to the next track. If this bothers you, you need a Flash memory MP3 player.- Battery life again. Expectations aren't everything. The next model really needs an upgraded battery. Charging this thing constantly if you watch movies is a real pain. It could be so much better and I feel that Apple really cut corners with the battery.- Scratches. It does happen if you are stupid enough to walk around without a case. THE IPOD NEEDS A CASE. Any portable gadget needs a case. Technology has been around long enough for people to know this. There is no excuse.- Having to encode movies. Why can't Itunes do that? This was another bad choice for Apple unless they are catering to geeks only, which is fine by me. Seriously, if you are not that computer savy then this is not the video player for you. You need to have an understanding of audio/video compression to get the most out of this player.Apple doesn't even have a program to encode muxed files, which a lot of internet content are. I highly recommend everyone to 'acquire' Nero Digital from Nero 6. It is the best converter out there at the moment that negates any synch problems. ImToo and Videora are completely useless and make very poor files.- No wireless. Right now, wireless headphones for the Ipod Video are practically non-existent. Logitech seems to be trying to alleviate that, but their headphones are currently riddled with manufacturer defects and don't even support the Video. Let's move it along Apple. We need wireless.- Earbuds. For the first few months, they are fantastic. But, eventually they seem to adopt vibration problems and hearing a rattle in my right ear is REALLY annoying.All in all, it is the best MP3 player on the market right now. Period. There just isn't enough support for it from Apple or anyone else. Vehicles are just now coming Ipod ready and that is limited to certain models. Where is our support? Apple? Anyone?", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good Ipod.", "unixReviewTime": 1146096000, "reviewTime": "04 27, 2006"}

The ZEN VISION M is one of those best products in the MP3 field. when i first decided to buy an mp3 player, first of all like everybody and without thinking and comparing i bought the ipod nano. i was looking for a small mp3 player with a descent storage and of course it must be good looking. After, having the nano for two months, i got so bored. the nano can't hold anything else except music and photos that must be seen on 1.5 inch screen therefore you will need a loop if you want to view your pictures. i sold the nano to one of my friends and i got the san disk sansa e260, excuse me san disk but that thing is suck. tha material from which that thing was made can't compete with other mp3 player in the market. the e260 gives you that very cheap look although it costs me 220 USD. i returned tha sansa back to best buy and i decided to spend a little bit more and get something with a video (fully equipped) and a big screen. i started comparing between the 2 most rivals in the market, the ipod video and the ZEN Vision M. finally, i decided to buy the VISION M for the reasons below:1-the vision M is equipped with an FM tuner with a perfect reception for 70% of the channels.2-the vision M is equipped with an FM recorder so you can record your favorite radio show, song or game and listen to it later.3-the vision M is equipped with an excellent voice recorder. i made a test for the voice recorder in Best Buy, i recorded my voice talking in the middle of a crowd and WOW i can still hear my voice clearly4-the 2.5 inch LCD(high definition)screen is very clear and sharp that you can see your pictures very vivid plus, you have a zoom in feature. so i don't need a loop anymore!5-the player is customizable. you can change the defalut backgrounds with any picture uploaded on your player. Plus, the player comes equipped with 6 different backgrounds and fonts.6-the Vision M is not scratches and fingerprints magnet like the ipods.7-the included software is very easy to use. i got used to itunes and when i used the software included i found it pretty much similar and i dealt with it like if i have been using it long time ago.8-the player comes with a wall charger!! thank you so much creative for giving the player's buyer his rights. the ipod video doesn't come with a wall charger, you have to buy it seperately for around 30 USD, ipods are charged with the included USB cable which is ridiculous because i remember one time i was in a hotel and i couldn't listen to my ipod because the thing ran out of battery and i had no access to computers.9-sound quality is pretty much the same, but the included speakers with the creative are prettier than the ipod.10-the accessories for the Vision M started to show up in stores, DLO company made till now 2 different cases for it. plus, many different cases that you can find online especially on Amazon.com.11-the Vision M has better battery life, lasts 1 - 1.5 hours more than the ipod video when playing videos and more hours when you play music12-The vision M has one of the best features that ever came in an mp3 player before..you can search for your song alphabetically. plus, you can click on the vertical touch pad and a keyboard will apears on which type the name of your song using the touch pad and the player will look it up for you whereever this song exists. Isn't that excellen?Conclusion: the vision M offers you all the Ipod Video features plus the list above. for the same price. you pay 300 USD for both!!!!the Vision M from my opinion worth every penny sipmly because if you want to buy some accessories for the Ipod video to make it with the same features equipped in the Vision M you will have to spend at least 120 USD over the initial 300 USD to add the fm tuner and the voice recorder and you will never have zoom feature or customizable player.Some Remarks:-they say that the itunes is one of the pros of the ipods, i don't know why, this software can be downloaded for free even if you don't have an ipod!!!-they say that the accessories is on of the pros of the ipods, i don't know who's going to buy all these cases and speakers offered in the market by everybody?-they say that the ipods are easier to use. Feel this one and try it anywhere and you will find very easy to use and even easier.i hope that my review can be helpful. thank you creative for making such an excellent product and saving the customers from this bad monopoly called iPods...Regarding the accessories i placed an order for an awesome silicone case from DLO.com and i received it yesterday.. the case fits my vision M perfectly and i got the case on time wih no hassles.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "IPod Killer - Zen Vision M Is Way Better", "unixReviewTime": 1150934400, "reviewTime": "06 22, 2006"}

Also purchased the muvo and the toshiba gigabeat. The gigabeat died within a few days. The muvo is great for a flash player. But the ipod has some real problems.The creative is better than the ipod for us because of file sharing and file backups. The ipod will attach to ONE COMPUTER ONLY and it KNOWS if you try to get it to work with another. This caused us a lot of grief when we switched computers. Then the new computer we attached it to died and getting the music back off of the ipod was a real pain. If you are able to even get the files back off the ipod (it doesn't like to go that direction, apparently) it still will lose a lot of the tag info in the music library. (Wanna type all that in by hand?) Plus, since Apple's music file format is proprietary, we can't share files from the ipod to other players. (Does not play well with others! :-)The creative players do not have any of these problems. They will work on ANY new computer and accept imports of a variety of file formats. You can make as many backups of your music library on as many hard drives on as many computers as you like.Another difference is the sound quality and volume output. Creative players drive headphones with higher impedances and also have superior sound. Also, creative players have EQ settings that actually work! They sound very different, but the ipod EQ settings pretty much all sound the same. Furthermore, the creative players have custom EQ settings available if you don't like the presets that come with the player.The ipod is more attractive and a bit smaller than the creative, but such things don't concern me since I'm looking for the highest quality sound I can get. Unfortunately, few mp3 players on the market today are really audiophile quality, and the ones that are are only available in Korea. Apparently the US market is more concerned with \"features\" and \"style\".There are a few problems with the creative software. It has some bugs but is easy to use. The ipod's software is also easy to use. Both interfaces are easy to use, but the creative touch can sometimes be too sensitive. It does have a sensitivity setting that helps a bit with that.Both the ipod and creative would be much better if they had a line out instead of just the regular headphone jack. I would be happier also if the creative could handle lossless compression formats, too, but this is not a major concern.What player a person buys really depends on their priorities. I have no need to watch videos on a portable player (Although creative has a video player, too). I'm looking for non-proprietary file formats and good sound quality. I've seen a lot of my friends with ipods suffer the consequences of having the single computer attachment problem and proprietary file format issues. That can be a very serious problem. I understand there are third party software programs out there that may help some of these issues, but it still is a very suboptimal situation to have to deal with.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Problems with ipod", "unixReviewTime": 1149465600, "reviewTime": "06 5, 2006"}

You need to get a sense as to just how portable it really is, whether it's solid enough for the journey, and, in the case of the iPod with video, just how good the screen really is under various light conditions. I've only had a few moments to check it out, but I'll share my observations. (Having had my nano screen break under normal usage on the very first day I owned it, I brought to the table a real concern about fragility, by the way. Apple, thankfully, replaced the broken nano with a new one, as they have acknowledged an apparent defect with some of the screens.)First, as you would expect, form and fit are first rate. The iPod seems to get smoother and more seamless with each generation. As with the nano, I think the scroll wheel has hit the sweet spot, too.Second, it seems more substantial and durable than the nano. Part of that has to do with the astounding thinness of the nano. There seems to be quite a bit more screen protection inherent in this iPod/video's design (and it is, after, considerably thicker than the nano, but still thin -- the 60 GB version is as thin as the 4th generation's 20 GB model, and the 30 GB is 30% thinner than that).Third, the screen is great. Clear, bright, and easy to read at a range of viewing angles (not that the latter is all that important for most iPods, but video changes all that ...). I must say, however, that it pales in comparison to the Sony PSP's gorgeous widescreen as a platform for watching videos. (The PSP's larger screen is a wonder, both for games and movies. Apple has obviously decided -- at least for the iPod -- to sacrifice optimal screen size for portability. More on that in a second.)Fourth, the slightly sour note. Once you've held the nano, used it, it makes this iPod feel too wide and heavy. Wide to a point where it doesn't easily nestle in the hand. It's the screen, of course, that is responsible. This is where you'll need to pick one up, hold it, check it out. It may be awkward to put in an armband for sports, for example. I found it consmetically less attractive because of that width, but, of course, you'll need to be the judge. Videos look great on it, as do photographs and album art. It's a great platform for catching with Lost -- or Desperate Housewives. But video comes at a price, of course. (Perhaps Apple could have changed the orientation of the screen so as to keep the width in check. Maybe. I'd have preferred that, I think.)The iPod/video is a compromise platform where, as Steve Jobs put it, video is \"icing on the cake.\" It may be a bit too much icing for some, given the physical effects it had on design. For those folks, the nano is absolutely perfect, and rumor has it that the nano's capacity will get a jolt upward in the spring if the 2 GB or 4 GB models don't hold enough for your liking.Another very nice product from Apple.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great iPod ... but too big?", "unixReviewTime": 1129248000, "reviewTime": "10 14, 2005"}

Its physical appearance, quality, craftsmanship, and the wide array of features are keeping me entertained!The iPod with video playback was introduced on October 13, 2005. However, one should not necessarily consider this player a video player, but a great iPod music player, with video capabilities as a fantastic bonus. Nevertheless, the iPod with video playback is the most capable and feature-rich iPod ever produced by Apple.Video Playback - The iPod plays back H264 and MPEG4 encoded video. The iPod's new display is larger than ever at 2.5 inches, giving it a resolution of 320x240. What video content can you play on your iPod? This area is limited, at least currently. You can buy music videos on iTunes at $1.99 per song, which will play beautifully on the iPod. Furthermore, Apple has made available select television shows, for download on iTunes. They cost $1.99 per episode, for titles including ABC's hits Lost and Desperate Housewives. You can also watch the episodes you purchase on your computer. If you want to put some of your own video, onto your iPod, you will need to use an application such as QuickTime Pro to convert the video to the specific requirements to play on the iPod. You can also find video podcasts, which will play on the new iPod. Even if you do not plan to view video on the new iPod, its primary purpose is to be used as the world's best music player. You can still benefit from the beautiful new display, for it will help you find your favorite music faster, and you can view the album art that accompanies your music.  I find myself looking forward to watching videos and video podcasts, on my new iPod!Size of new iPod - Does the picture of the new iPod make it appear larger to you? Well, it did to me. The iPod looked wider, in the photos I saw. However, it is not. The height and width of the iPod are identical to the previous generation iPod with click wheel. The only change in dimensions is the depth. The new iPod is actually thinner than what came before it! Yes, this 30 gig iPod is thinner than the previous 20 gig photo model by 30 percent. What does all this mean? The iPod continues get smaller, making it even easier to carry.Capacity - This 30 gig iPod has room, for a lot of entertainment. With storage, for up to 7,500 songs, 12,000 photos, or 75 hours of video. The great thing I love about my iPod is that my music, photos, and video only take up about 15 gigabytes. However, I use the additional space to backup data, from my computer. This is incredibly helpful, and could be a real saver, if something happened to your computer. See, the iPod functions as an external hard drive, so you can backup all sorts of data. The 60 gig version is available, for $100 more, so if you want to use it for lots of video, or you have an enormous music collection, you may want to consider that larger version, which also sports longer battery life.New Software Features - Apple has added features, to the new iPod besides video support. First, they have a clock feature, which quickly allows you to view the time, in up to four different time zones simultaneously. Furthermore, there is a stop watch, and a screen lock, which you can enable to keep people from snooping on your calendar and/or contacts.Battery - The battery life is one of the most important specifications that you, as an iPod user, are going to care about. This 30 gigabyte iPod sports a battery that will last up to 14 hours, when playing only music. Also note that repeatedly changing songs manually, and turning on the backlight will use up your battery considerably faster. Furthermore, the iPod's battery lasts a maximum of two hours, when playing back video. This version of the iPod no longer includes an adapter to charge the iPod, at an electrical outlet. You will have to buy that adapter separately, or always charge the iPod via USB 2.0. The charging works fine, from your computer's USB 2.0, but if you're traveling you might want the ability to charge, with the adapter. Also note that the iPod no longer supports syncing via firewire cable. You will have to use USB 2.0.Mac or PC? This iPod works beautifully with either a Mac or PC. The iPod syncs your contacts, video, and music via the iTunes software.Podcasting - The iPod continues to support podcasting. Podcasts are internet radio broadcasts, and there are thousands covering nearly every subject imaginable, and more are coming out every day. Podcasts are quickly becoming popular content on iPods around the world. Check them out, for this iPod supports Podcasts out of the box. There are also video podcasts, so with the new iPod, you will be able to watch video podcasts, on the iPod's display.Appearance - The iPod is beautiful, but the back's chrome finish is prone to scratches, and the screen can become scratched as well. It is a very good idea to protect the back of the iPod and the screen in some way. There are many cases and protectors out there, and you will surely find something you like. The new iPod is available in a black or white finish. The black color is quickly becoming the most popular, but the white iPod is still the signature color. Do note that the black may show fingerprints and scratches more than the white iPod, much as a black car shows these blemishes more than a lighter colored car.Audiobooks - I'm always using my iPod, to listen to audiobooks. You can store literally hundreds of audiobooks on here that you buy from iTunes, or Audible. The iPod even has a feature that can slow down or speed up the reading of the audiobook, so that you hear it at just the right pace.Output - The iPod connects to your PC or Mac via the dock connector at the bottom of the unit. You will connect the included cable, to the computer via a USB 2.0 port. Furthermore, accessories are being made that will also connect to the bottom dock port, and you may purchase Apple's Universal iPod dock, for easy syncing to your computer. The dock (available separately) also includes s-video output, so you can show off slideshows and video, on a television. There are also iPod A/V cables available that allow composite video and audio output, for connecting your iPod to your television. This might interest you, not only to display slideshows on a television, but also to display TV shows or music videos on a television, which you purchased from iTunes.Overall, this is another excellent product from Apple Computer. The design is elegant, simple, and intuitive. It will provide hours of entertainment and convenience.

Thousand of pictures were shrunken and converted all automatically, one big batch, no problems.  Same with music.  Exporting them to the iPod: also a breeze, no prompts required to automatically get all that content into the iPod.But my videos were another matter entirely.  I was able to download videos from the Apple store, and play them on my PC and Ipod, with no trouble.  But the process of converting my home video clips (taken with digital camera) from QuickTime format (isn't that Apple already?) into the exact flavor of Mpeg-4 that the iPod requires is truly painstaking.  Literally hours of excruciatingly slow processing are required to convert each short home video clip from Apple's own QuickTime format into iPod friendly format, one at a time.  My Palm pilot with a 3rd party add-on plays those Apple Quicktime files just fine, no conversion required - why can't my Apple iPod?  It seems bizarre that Apple's hardware is so incompatible with its software.  Ideally all my Quicktime movies would be sucked up automatically in one big batch by I-Tunes and exported just as easily, as-is, to the iPod.

Would have been even quicker but I took time t read the reviews and update the firmware to the latest version as well as the new voice (JILL) from Garmin's site.  Perhaps that's what made the difference.No freezes. No unexpected reboots. Been smooth sailing all the way.A few things that weren't documented.The GPS can be tiled forward and backward as well as rotated on it's mount.  I was a bit concerned when I first put the unit on my dash because my dash angles back. I was afraid I would be able to get a good angle in sunlight to see the screen. Garmin's mount design is brilliant but I discoverd the tilt feature quite by accident when I grapsed the unit to push down on the self-adhesive gasket.I live near Chicago -- very congested area constantly changing. I was pleasantly surprised the mapset has a lot of recent developments.One thing I thought I would hate is the speaker on the power cable. But it angles back to lie flush with the dash and I LOVE the sound. My old TOM TOM could barely be heard over road noise once I got over 55 mph.  The GARMIN speaker is high quality and the female voice isn't drowned out. Very responsive as far as routing and prompting turns. Much faster than my old GPS 60CS in fact.I have a route to a local beach on Lake Michigan which features a series of rapid turns in succession. The 2720 keeps up with amazing speed. And if I miss a turn it seems to detect it much quicker than my 60CS and reroutes almost immediately.I couldn't be more pleased with this purchase. I toyed with the idea of getting the 2730 but XM Radio/XM Traffic just wasn't something I was interested in at this point in time.I highly recommend this device.If you buy it UPDATE the firmware immediately and update the voice. The new firmware features a new interface/map layout than what's shown in the promo pics on Amazon and Garmin. The Turn Arrow icon has been moved of the sidebar and now overlays the map. And the Direction Text is no longer across the top in a greenbar but on the sidebar in a box.

I had reached the age where the cones in my eyes were disappearing faster than an Artic glacier. (heheh) Reading my street map books, even with a magnifying glass besides the the time trying to determine plotting routes to snap my comparable photos everyday, was becoming more frustating and time consuming. I couldn't even begin to tell you the time my 2610 has saved me. I plug in all my addresses for my assignments the night before and it has made my driving schedule a lot easier and pleasureable- even in Los Angeles traffic.As with others, I have found the Garmin support staff to be lacking in response and solutions. I have been unable to reach anyone on the 800 lime. The only response I appear to receive is by a 3-4 day e-mail. My 2610 system is loaded with City Navigator 5, which works fine in older established neighborhood areas. As my coverage area for appraisals has expanded this year and involves newer neighborhood tracts, my 2610's data has shown its age. The newer street names and/or neighborhoods aree not available to me. After a couple of attempts the past three months, I have been unable to order and/or receive the updated CN 7 disc for my 2610 StreetPilot. Very frustrating!I finally gave up in frustration a couple of weeks ago and purchased a 2720. There are some things about each StreetPilot I like better.Navigation: the 2720 is faster than the 2610. It notifies and modifies my route more quickly if I get off track, especially with WAAS on. I like having the voice announce the upcoming street names, but it wasn't a chore or distraction to quickly glance at the street name on the 2610's screen. The 2610's screen gives more street names than the 2720, which is important to me when trying to familarizing myself with neighborhoods. The 2610's screen is a bit more simpified, but highlights your \"from-to\" route and the arrow seems to following more consistently and smoother that the 2720's cursor. My 2610 prompted my at approximately one mile, approximately 1/2 mile, and again at 400'-200' feet, which was a nice option. My 2720 only informs at one mile, 1/2 mile, and when you get right to the street. I like the additional 200'-400' feet warning on my 2610. Having the entire U.S. coverage pre-loaded on my 2720 is a major plus instead of having several memory cards for various sections of the country I travel to with my 2610.Screen: I'm still trying to get used to the 3D screen on the 2720. I'm finding it distracting and doesn't give me an overview of the progression my route. The large white destination arrow actually blocks the map, which makes looking for and comprehending my destination route/point harder to view on screen. While it's a nice added feature, I'm using the 2D screen on my 2720 more than the 3D option.Volume: 2720's voices are softer and not as loud as my 2610's voice. If I turn the volume up on the 2720, the voices distort. Sometimes I feel my 2610's voice was too loud, but I could always hear it over the radio. I'm not finding that to be the case with the 2720.Setup: the 2720's screen is more responsive to imput with my fingers than the 2610. The setup screen is easier having both letter and numbers on one page than having to flip pages for numbers and letters on the 2610. It is easier to save and store routes and jump between modes on the 2720 than my 2610.At this point I heve decided to use both my 2610 and 2720 despending on my assignment area. Each seems to have advantages/disadvantages that I like/dislike. I'll update everyone at a future point as to how well this method is working and/or if I'm ever able to receive an updated City Navigaotor 7 for my 2610 from Garmin. I'm also curious to find out if each model plots a same route. As the 2610 has come down significantly in price from a couple of years ago, I think most people would find it will satisfy their needs- if it comes with City Navigator 7.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Sometimes I feel 26 and other times 27", "unixReviewTime": 1151107200, "reviewTime": "06 24, 2006"}

It tried to take me on a \"shorter\" path home but by avoiding I-5 it added 15 minutes to the trip.  20 seconds after starting my journey it asked me to turn left on to a non-existant street.  There was no street anywhere near here either so it wasn't a case of just being off a little.  I drove straight and finally ran into a road it recognized and it got me home from there.  Overall I was unhappy with the lack of accuracy and choice to avoid the freeway when I was looking for the fastest route.I returned it an hour later and bought the Garmin 2720.  Not only did it take me right back on the freeway and get me home in a hurry I decided to use it to find my girlfriends house.  She happens to live in an extremely difficult area to get to.  Her address starts with 010 and if you use Mapquest it forces you to truncate the leading 0 which puts you on the right street but on the wrong side of a major parkway which is very time consuming to get around.  It gave me the perfect route to get to her taking the exact set of turns INCLUDING a quick right then left that had me get back onto the same street I was on but turning left to cross it and head the opposite direction - the only possible way to reach her.  I was ecstatic it didn't try to lead me downtown to make some convoluted turn around.  It used my own exact set of turns.When it indicates your current speed I've found this accurate to less than 1mph of what my speedometer indicates.  This makes the estimated time of arrival indicator very accurate.The POI's are robust and being new to the area I enjoy being able to search for things like restaurants by cuisine and when looking up movie theaters it gives a phone number so I can check the listings on the go.I found the software on the unit was a little dated however Garmin had a web updater I downloaded that brought me up to the current version with no prompts except a license agreement.  The windows software is easy to plot waypoints & routes from home and upload via the USB cable.It comes with a heavy fabric paperweight I guess you'd call it with a rubberized bottom for setting it on the dash.  This made me nervous at first but it actually weighs a couple pounds and is a tacky rubber that should keep it in place during anything but an accident or a U-turn that qualifies as a felony.All in all I'm very happy with the unit and returning the Tomtom was a good move for me.  This thing isn't cheap but Amazon has a great price on it as usual.Update January 12, 2008.  Last month the unit began \"restarting\" over and over.  It would turn on and run for 5-30 seconds then restart like it was unplugged and plugged back in.  I had an extended warranty and Garmin ended up swapping it for a new one.  Took about 6 weeks.  I'm disappointed it failed but am still very happy with the performance.  A year or so ago I took a trip to Disneyland and when returning home I was looking for a hotel in Northern California.  Three were full so I asked what's up.  Due to fires, most rooms were booked for the fire crews.  I did a search for hotels on the Garmin and it includes phone numbers for most.  I was able to call around (took a lot of tries) but finally found a room.

I live in the middle of a development and to get to my home from a main street, one has to make 5 quick turns. The 2720 got them all, announcing the direction of the turn and the name of the street in each case.  In going to a nearby store, the device had three choices: two parellel streets (the farthest being the one with the destination address), and a freeway in the middle, but whose on-ramp was some 2 miles away.  Correctly, it had me take the first left and go to the freeway.  On the return trip, I made a u-turn into a fast-food restaurant.  Twice the device had to re-calculate, which it did.  It got me back on track and home.  I haven't tried the other features (restuarants, etc.), but so far I am extremely impressed.

It worked great and even plotted a faster, better course than I would have taken and saved me a few $$ on tolls as well.

Fast recalculations if you take a wrong turn.Minuses:1. If there is a N, S, E, or W in a route NAME, it assumes North, South, East or West. I was on Route 9W which is the name of the route and it told me 9 West.2. Some items in the database are not completely accurrate. When I was going to my hotel that was very close to an intersection of two main roads, it told me to turn Left when the hotel was clearly on the Right. Also when I go HOME and turn into my street, it says my house is on the Left when it's actually on the Right. Fortunately these type mistakes don't happen often and if you do make a wrong turn it recalculates quickly.3. When recalculating because you took a wrong turn or different route, the female voice sounds like it's annoyed when it says \"Recalculating\". :-)Overall this is a great gadget.

Israel", "helpful": [30, 36], "reviewText": "I recently purchased the 2720 when my Magellan Rodadmate 700 went on the fritz.  (Turns out it was not really broken afterall, I had just stored it with something on top of the screen and it needed a day to recover).  After a week of comparing the two, I returned the 2720.I am generally a big fan of Garmin products.  Their handhelds and aviation units are world class.  The main reason I bought the 700 two years ago was that at the time it was the only unit with a built in HDD.  I was surprisingly pleased with it but now thought I would give the latest Garmin StreetPilot a shot.  I find it to be a good unit with some innovative features such as the real time traffic update option.  Still, it has some surprising shortcomings in the software realm.Lets start with the screen.  The good news is that the resolution and readability in all conditions is outstanding.  Definitely best in class.  COmpletely visible in sunlight while the night mode is nice and easy on the eyes.  The bad news is that it is physically a bit smaller than the Magellan.  This would not be a big deal were it not for the fact that 1/4 of that smaller screen is taken up by a speed indicator and estimated time of arrival on the right side.  This results in a map view that is MUCH smaller than that of the Roadmate.  Look at the screenshots of the two units, you will see that the Rodamate displays its information using a semi-transparent overlay at top or bottom of the screen and then switches to a split screen as you approach a turn.  Why Garmin wastes aquarter of the screen space is beyond me.  Maybe if they had a BIG screen like the Lowrance units but they do not.  This leads me to the next point, configurability.One of the strenghts of older Garmin units was that you could configure them in many different ways to your liking.  This is not really the case with the StreetPilot.  For example, on that right side of the screen it displays vehicle speed.  Unless my speedometer is broken this is useless information and I would prefer to replace it with something like distance to destination.  No such flexibility exists.  FYI, the Magellan displays BOTH estimated time to destination and distance simultaneously.I will say that the spoken street names work well.  Pronunciation is good, and prompts usually make sense.  The Magellan 700 does not offer this and just tells you things like, \"Right turn in .2 miles\".  The choice of routes and quality of maps is essentially equal.  The 2720 does show more detail on the maps.  Generally you will get routes that make sense although both units will sometimes send you on a less than optimal or logical course.  In most cases they will bothget you there.The Magellan wins over the 2720 is in terms of the navigation menus itself.  For example, the 2720 gives you a choice of fastest time or shortest time.  Magellan offers these as well as \"Least Use of Highways\", \"Most Use of Highways\".  You can configure the 2720 with similar preferences but you need to navigate through many menus to change these, and can not easily do so on a per trip basis.  Even with the existing choices, on the Magellan I can select a destination with say \"Fastest Time\".  If I do not like that route I hit \"Back\" and then canpick \"shortest distance\", two clicks total.  On the 2720 I must go all the way back to reselecting my destination, then routing choice, a process of navigating multiple menus.  On both units I can quickly switch screens from map to route listing (you will need to updgrade to the latest version of software on the Garmin to do this).  But even here, the Garmin initially shows me ony the next 2-3 upcoming turns, I have to push another button to see the complete list, an extra and unnecessary step.  The only interface plus for the Garmin is the inclusion of the remote.As mentioned, The 2720 is innovative in including the ability to add on real time traffic.  This does requires purchase of an additional $200 module and a subscription fee after the first 15 months.  It is a nice feature which Magellan should offer and which Garmin should build into the unit itself..  Do note that service only covers major roads in certain areas so value may vary.You will not be unhappy with the Garmin, I just happen to believe that the Roadmate is a better choice in terms of both simplicity out of the box and advanced features and configuration when you need them.  As the top of the line unit,  it really needs to offer much more than their less pricey units.  It almost seems that Garmin decided to save money by using a common interface software on all their units.  That is OK for someone who owns multiple Garmins.  However, the buyer of their premium unit expects lots of bells, whistles, and configuration options not found on the lesser units.  If you want a Garmin, you can get most of the features of the 2720 on their other models for less money.In my case I have returned the 2720.  It is good but underwhelming.  It just does not seem to offer enough over my 2 year old Magellan 700 let alone the newer 760 and 800 series.

I have an old one, and this has bendable metal inserts in the beanbag 4 legs which makes it so it will NOT move off the dash (however the TSA can't see through this metal and if this is in my carry on, it always invites a hand search).I wish they would have gone back to that.... instead of skimping here.  Also the carry case which is optional is cheesier than the previous one.  Not different, just not as good material.  Again cost cutting but quality cutting as well.The last thing is that this GPS is loaded with everything, so no need for Mapping programs like Mapsource.  However it IS COMPATIBLE with Mapsource whih makes it EASTER to share data and save data.  BUT Mapsource City Navigator is NOT INCLUDED.

{"reviewerID": "A1FOXAXSU02MPO", "asin": "B000A5T7AO", "reviewerName": "Tom Curious", "helpful": [264, 267], "reviewText": "I am currently trying out the Garmin 2720 and the Magellan 6000, both top end units, to see which one I am going to keep. Tough choice ! Both are terrific for routing, have all the advanced features, like text to speech and traffic info option, but neither one is perfect.Here are the pros and cons of the Garmin 2720, as compared to the Magellan Roadmate 6000:Pros:1. The maps of the 2720 are much more readable. On the 6000, it is hard to see which street label belongs to which line. The 6000 is also practically useless to use as a map (just scrolling and zooming around), since it is way too slow and jumpy. The 2720 is perfect in these respects. Scrolling is very smooth. When a destination is entered, the corresponding map is shown, and can be zoomed in. Very cool. I had first tested the 6000, and once I tried the 2720 I could not believe how good it was (or how bad the 6000 was). The map quality is a difference like day and night. With the 6000, I had trouble to understand the map even for the areas I am familiar with, like the block around our home or office.2. Dash mount. I prefer the beanbag mount of the 2720, since it is easy to move from one car to another, or to stow away. Plus, the windshield mount is not legal in CA. For the 6000, no beanbag option is offered yet. With the beanbag mount, the unit does usually sit a little farther away from the driver (at least in my car), but this is no problem with the 2720, since it has a convenient remote control.Cons:1. No battery ! Very annoying that you can program your route on the 2720 only after starting the car. This problem is compounded by the long startup time of the 2720 (around 10 sec vs. 1 second for the 6000), and the fact that the 2720 does not start to navigate until it has a satellite lock. So when I start the car, enter my destination and start driving, there will be no directions. The 2720 then has trouble to get the inital satellite lock while driving, so I have to pull over and wait until it has the lock and gives directions. The 6000 starts navigating from the last known position. Also, I can take the 6000 home and program it from my sofa, then take it with me to the car and start driving.2. Interactive POI: most POI (like restaurants) are not displayed on the 2720 map. You need to search for them via menu, and then get a list. On the 6000, you see the icons for restaurants, gas station etc. displayed right on the map, and you can click on an icon to get details or to have the 6000 plot the route to them.3. POI search. On the 2720, you can only search for POI around your current location, or any other specific location that you need to enter first. If you don't know the approximate location, you are out of luck. With the 6000, you can enter a restaurant name and bring up matches for the whole state. I used it to find a restaurant in a city 300 miles away, and it only took a few seconds. On the 2720, it was very difficult to find it at all.4. Destination search. If you enter a city or street that does not exist (due to typo), the 2720 will bring up a prompt \"Not found\". The 6000 is much smarter and does not even let you enter something invalid. If you enter the first city letter, for example, then it presents only those letters for your choice of the 2nd letter that correspond to actual cities in the database, others are grayed out. Very convenient.5. Destination entry order. With the 6000, you enter the street first. You can omit prefixes like N or S. It will then show you the available range of numbers. This is very convenient if you just want to drive to a certain street (i.e. you know that a certain restaurant is on that street), but don't know the number. Enter the street first on the 6000, then pick some number in the middle of the available range and go. It will also figure out the street prefix based on the number. With the 2720, you need to enter the number first, and then later you get a prompt to correct it if it was invalid.6. Locate button. The 6000 has one. Press it, and it shows you city and nearby street and other details, and you can also save it. The 2720 has no such feature.7. Route options. Both have \"shortest time\" or \"shortest distance\" options, but only the 6000 also has options \"prefer freeways\" and \"avoid freeways\".8. Screen size. The 6000 screen is a bit larger.I have not made a decision yet. Even though there are only two areas where the 2720 has the advantage over the 6000, these two points weigh heavily. Especially the map readability, since this is one of the main reasons to have a GPS. As I said, tough choice.UPDATE AS OF 08/21/06:I returned the Magellan 6000. Due to the poor map display, it was of little use, no matter what features it offered.The 2720, even with the shortcommings listed above, is much more usable and even enjoyable in daily use. I have also updated it's firmware with the latest version from the Garmin website (was very easy to do), and now at least item 3 (POI search) is pretty much fixed. It still takes quite long to find a POI that is far away (2 minutes vs. 10 seconds on the 6000, for a POI 300 miles away). But at least you can find it at all, plus it gives an indication of the increasing search radius while it is searching. Since such a search scenario is pretty infrequent, I can live with the delay. The fact that Garmin improved the firmware also makes me hopefull that some of the other shortcommings can be fixed over time (except for the missing battery of course).As for the missing battery, we compared the 2720 against the Garmin nuvi 360, which has a very similar feature set and operation, but includes a battery. The nuvi 360 has some advantages, it's ideal for carrying around and has a few extras like MP3 player. Still, our verdict was to stick with the 2720. This was mosty my wife's decision who by now has fallen in love with the 2720. It was due to the follwing advantages the 2720 has over the nuvi:- 2720 has a larger and brighter display- 2720 sits very secure on it's beanbag mount and can be moved easily to another vehicle. It feels and is more robust.- 2720 includes the City Navigator on DVD, where you can plan your route ahead of time and make changes, then download it to the 2720. This is invaluable for larger trips. Even if you don't make any changes, it is very helpful to preview the route on the larger computer screen, zoom into sections etc. We tried it for one route and found it to be terrific. (Only inconvenience again is that you need to connect the unit to an AC adaptor in addition to the computer as it has no battery)- The audio is a bit better, due to the larger speakerSo bottom line, we decided on this GPS, the Garmin Street Pilot 2720. I'll keep it a 3 stars for it's missing battery and other smaller shortcommings, but after our research it's still the best unit out there.UPDATE AS OF 08/28/06:We have now completed our first longer trip with the 2720, and it worked out great. So we are confident that we made the right decision. Routing was efficient, it picked the perfect routes and guided us flawlessly. The best part however, as compared to other devices, is the terrific quality of the map display. It looks that the 2720 is smart enough to always show the right angle and zoom, depending where you are (on highway, approaching a ramp, in rural area, in city streets etc), to give you the most information. Also, the map is very easy and quick to grasp, even in an unfamiliar area, which is important while driving. Just to give an example: While on the highway, traffic was slowing, and we could see a jam ahead. There was also an exit just comming up. Wondering if I should take it, I glanced at the 2720 and saw that it displayed the exit, highlighted a parallel street a few blocks away, and even showed at a bird's eye view how that street would merge back onto our highway a few miles away. So I just took the exit, and the 2720 recalculated the route immediately and guided me on the parallel road and then back onto the highway later. Voila, the jam was gone. I did not have to press any button or interact with the 2720 in any way while doing the detour. I guess when using the traffic info feature, the 2720 would even do such recommendation proactively, but I have not tried this yet. It works just fine the way it is.To round this review up, during daily use we have found that we do not miss the few firmware shortcommings that much (and Garmin is improving on them). The battery we do miss a bit, but less than we originally thought. You will have to decide for yourself, of course. We found that once the novelty of the GPS wears off, we no longer carry the unit home that much to play with it (for which we'd miss the battery). And while driving, we just enjoy the precise directions and the terrific map.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good navigator, with several flaws", "unixReviewTime": 1155686400, "reviewTime": "08 16, 2006"}

Here are a few problems that I found.1.) During the initial test of the unit, I looked up \"Casinos.\"  It could not find the casino in my hometown that had been there for 10+ years (nor one just 2 hours away that had been there for 6 years).  It did however find several others that were either in major cities or had been there longer.2.) In the neighboring town (population 3500), it listed 60% of the streets as \"county route #\" rather than the actual street name.3.) We tried to find a church for a wedding we were attending located outside the city limits on backroads.  After browsing the map (visually) we found the street.  However the unit could not find it via typing because after a few letters it tried to guess the street name.  Normally this would be a very nice feature, but (at times) it isn't close.  And, as I listed above, it may not even know the street name.  I'm not sure if this can be turned off yet or not.Most of these problems I wouldn't even know about had I not tested it in an area I was already familiar with.  And this area has a low population.  I just expected the maps to be more \"up to date.\"  Overall I have no regrets.  This unit does exactly what it should.  It is extremely easy to use and has a lot of nice features. Pre-programmed points of interest such as: gas stations, hotels, food etc.  It will tell you where they are (starting with the closest), how many miles, and estimate the time you will arrive.  And with one click on \"Home\" it will recalculate and direct you back to where you were staying.  I would recommend this to anyone...***LESS THAN ONE MONTH LATER***Not sure if I have a defective item or not.  We decided to drive a few hours to a nearby major city to do some christmas shopping and have dinner.  The unit did a good job getting us down there (although half of the drive it tooks us on backroads rather than major highways).  It found the area we were looking for with ease.  However the restaurants were another story.  The first restaurant we searched for wasn't even there (I assume it went out of business).  The second search should have only been 8 miles away, however it ended up sending us on a \"wild goose chase\" for about 15 miles, then it started to turn us around and head back the way we came.  We did another search and found the restaurant to be less than a mile away.  Another problem we found is that it doesn't seem to know the difference between left and right.  About 50% of the time it announced the exit to be on the wrong side of the road (along with the last restaurant).I realize this is new technology, however I would have expected better from Garmin.  .....Seriously considering returning the C340!!!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great unit, however needs more map detail", "unixReviewTime": 1129939200, "reviewTime": "10 22, 2005"}

For example, in the iQue, the street numbers are displayed as you travel down the road; not so with the c340. In the c340, only the street names that are perpendicular to the road you are traveling are displayed (maybe there's a setting I'm missing). I want to know the names of the street adjacent to the one I'm traveling.With that said, the c340 interface is super easy to use. The text-to-speech voices are decent. Additional text-to-speech voices can be downloaded from Garmin. I'm currently running either British male voice or the Aussie male voice. The real time traffic information works well. It alerts you of potential traffic on the road you are traveling or on your route. You can then avoid said traffic by doing a re-route. Be sure to get Garmin GTA-11 and NOT GTA-10 traffic module. The GTA-11 module includes a built-in FM antenna where the GTA-10 does not.One more quibble about the c340 is the timeliness of the map database (maybe this is NAVTEQ's fault).

The units to avoid included many Garmin units (such as this one) because these units are not being sold with the latest GPS receiver (the SIRF Star III) which is supposed to provide dramatically better results in traditional problem areas (tall buildings, urban areas, tunnels, etc). I confirmed this information with other websites and then decided to order the Garmin Nuvi 350, which has both the new GPS receiver and the other features I wanted.

{"reviewerID": "A1HF6TIJ0YV6JO", "asin": "B000A5TAT2", "reviewerName": "J. Carlile \"JC\"", "helpful": [289, 293], "reviewText": "First of all, I'm an electronics junkie.  My house looks like the Star Ship Enterprise, and I'm extremely picky concerning the function of everything that I purchase. Probably too picky.  So, after being more than impressed with the Garmin StreetPilot c340, I decided to write this review.  I purchased this unit due to an upcoming road trip to Florida, and I'm HORRIBLE with directions.  It seemed like the logical thing to do. After much research on the latest GPS units, the c340 seemed to be best suited for my needs, financially and functionally.PROS:As stated time and time again, the c340 is extremely user-friendly straight from the box.  No bulky manual is included (although one can be downloaded on-line), most likely due to the fact that it is not needed. There's a brief start-up guide which is more than sufficient to get this thing up and running. Simply let the satellite locate your home location, which takes a few minutes and only has to be done once, and you're ready to input your next destination.  Hit \"Where to?\" on the touchscreen and everything is made perfectly clear.  It could not be any simpler.  You'll then have options to enter addresses, food locations, lodging, your saved favorite locations and recent browsed selections, fuel, intersections, attractions, shopping, parking, entertainment, recreation, community, near-by cities, hospitals, transit, and auto service locations.  There's no guess-work involved: just touch the type of place you wish to find and go; you'll get plenty of options.  You can also touch the \"Near...\" option, type in a city of destination, and it'll pull up businesses in that city for your convenience.  Again, this unit is extremely easy to navigate.  Pick your destination, hit \"Go\", and you're all set. Just follow the highlighted path and you're sure to get there with ease. I've had no problems or long-term satellite loss in my area so far. Phone numbers are also shown which would be especially convenient when making hotel reservations on the road.The suction mount is also very nice.  I was skeptical about it at first: What if it falls off?  Will I be able to see the road? No worries; it's great.  Like the unit itself, the mount is high-quality and very sturdy.  Just attach the c340, place the mount into position (I have it right under my rear view mirror), and pull the lever down.  I don't see any way that this mount could fall off, and it's not a distraction while driving.  I hear that it's illegal in California, but I really don't see why.  It provides the perfect location for the unit and is no more distracting than the rear view mirror.  A dash-mount disc is included also for CA residents or in case you'd prefer a lower location, but it's a permanent mount, so I'd advise caution if going with this option.  I won't use it myself.As far as power goes, a 12V adapter is included for the car, but don't worry about buying the AC adapter.  The c340 includes a USB cable that allows it to be powered and charged via any computer with a USB port. Very convenient when planning out trips at home to save battery life. The USB cable also allows you to download male voices from the Garmin site such as American English Jack, Australian English Lee, and British English Daniel which is very cool.CONS:Not much to say here.  The only 'major' thing I've noticed so far is that some local businesses are not in the database, and a few businesses are present which no longer exist.  It's kind of strange: local mom and pop stores can be pulled up, but NO Walmarts in my area.  I have three Walmarts within 25 miles of my home, and none are in the database.  I didn't subtract any points since all Garmin GPS units seem to utilize the same database (nearly 6 million points of interest) and it does have the potential to be updated. Also, keep your eye on the road during exits as it may not detect recent route changes. It will recalculate a new route if you simply go past the road that has changed; you won't get lost, but it can be an inconvenience. It's happened only once to me so far and I've been doing a lot of traveling. It was a familiar area and I didn't even realize that the road had changed. Again, this is a Garmin database problem which hopefully will be addressed in a future update.The voices for the most part are spot on.  They can pronounce streets that I've been mispronouncing for years.  However, every now and then it's hard to decipher what they're saying as they can sound overly-digitized. This is just a minor inconvenience since most of the time they're flawless, but keep your eye on the screen just in case you don't understand the street name. No big deal really. I use American English Jill, and she is usually very accurate with pronunciations. British English Daniel is also easy to understand, although he must be downloaded.CONCLUSION:All-in-all, I'm very, VERY impressed with the performance of the Garmin c340.  This is my first GPS, and I can't imagine needing anything more.  I'm not sure what these $1000+ units do, but unless they drive me to my destination and pump my gas, I don't need them. I've heard people complain that the touch screen collects finger prints.  Hmmm...unless you have jelly, paint, or motor oil on your fingers, it does not detract from the display.  Hello, it's a TOUCHscreen. Of course it's going to get finger prints on it.  Wipe it off now and then and you're good to go.  I've also heard complaints that sometimes the unit doesn't give you ample time to turn via text-to-speech.  Well, I've been driving everywhere with this thing for the past three days, and it verbally tells you TWICE when to turn, by street name and in which direction to turn.  It tells you once within a 1/4 mile or so and once again right before the turn.  If you miss your turn after two verbal prompts, a big white arrow on the GPS screen, and the name of the street at the top of the screen, you may want to reconsider this whole driving thing.  The turn alert is almost overkill; if you're awake and free from severe brain damage, you can't possibly miss it. Maybe this was a problem with some of the older units, but mine is perfect. Perhaps these people didn't hear the first prompt and of course the voice prompt times will be shorter with city driving, but that's to be expected. As far as satellite loss, I've only experienced a couple seconds of it while driving so far which is no inconvenience at all.  There is an optional generic antenna that can be purchased for around $20 if this is a problem in some areas. The actual Garmin antenna costs more, but I've had no need for it so far.After three days of taking the c340 everywhere, I absolutely love it; I have no regrets whatsoever.  It's one of the top 3 electronic purchases I've ever made in my life.  I can't wait to take it to Florida and find all the local attractions that I would never have been able to locate otherwise. This thing is great. I've already had two friends order the c340 after seeing how well mine works. I guarantee you won't be disappointed!UPDATE:I just returned from Florida, and I love this thing even more.  We never had any need for a map: I simply typed in each destination and we got there with no problems whatsoever.  When we got a craving for some baby back ribs on the interstate, I simply hit food, barbecue, got a nice little list of local restaurants, picked one and hit GO.  It takes you right there!  It then took us right back to the interstate.

Graham", "helpful": [280, 283], "reviewText": "I was originally going to get the C320 but the text-to-speech feature made me decide to get the C340 instead.  Overall, after having owned this unit for approx. 2 years, I am pleased with it.  When I first got it, to build my faith in the product, I used it for a week just entering the places I normally go to see how the unit performed.First I tried to enter a restuarant I have been going to for years.  Route planning was very fast - the only problem is that the route took me 6 miles away from the restuarant into a residential neighborhood.  The destination was someone's house in this neighborhood!  To retest, I chose the restuarant address from the built in POI listing instead of typing it in...and the result was the same.  It had me going into a subdivision and to someone's house.  My second test was entering my work address.  This worked fairly well except that a 2-year old change in the road was not registered on the map.  So the unit got really confused when I was driving through what looked like a lake on the screen.  Recalculation can be irritating as the unit repeatedly tries to force you to do U-Turns to get back on what it thinks is the best route.  I'm sure this is region specific.Bottom line here...don't rely on the restuarant listings.My next test was a little longer - it was a 25 mile drive to my mother's house.  Again, route planning was very fast (3-4 seconds).  The route was very accurate to her house but the route seemed to favor toll roads and highways.  The result was the same when I modified the preferences to prefer \"back roads\" and avoid highways.  About 7 miles into the trip to mom's house, the C340 locked up completely.  I reset it and reprogrammed the route (you have to stop the car to do this safely).  Then, 5 miles down the road it locked up again.  I checked for later firmware when I got home and there was none, but an email to customer support was all it took to get a firmware update that resolved this issue.So with various other tests, I give it a ~90% chance of picking the correct route to wherever you are going (at least in my area)...but often times it does get you where you intend to go but takes you far out of the way.  A few major highways are missing from the basemap in my area, which were corrected when I paid $75 for the 2006 map update.  Common sense and a backup map are sometimes necessary.Ok, about the unit itself...the text to speech is worth the extra money of you are considering buying it for that reason.  Text to Speech pronunciation has been corrected with several firmware revisions.  I have not had any major issues with the text-to-speech pronunciation since these firmware updates were applied.The screen is bright and the whole thing is smaller than I expected - but there really is no excuse for being upset about the size when you can go to Best Buy or Circuit City and see it for yourself.So:Pros - bright screen, doesn't wash out too bad (I have deeply tinted windows) and speech volume is appropriate.  Planning is quick.It is very accurate on where to turn, giving ample time for braking or lane changing.Cons - with earlier firm revisions it used to lock up frequently, power cable goes to mounting base, routing not accurate in many cases, and some POI are incorrect.  Searching an address is glacially slow.  Shows many obscure restuarants but overlooks the mainstream ones. Some of the cardinal directions are reversed.  I was going to get on an expressway going east and the directions said to go west.  (The drawn map was correct, just the speech was wrong)Bottom line is that after using this for routine trips around town as well as jaunts into unfamiliar areas, I recommend it.Update: 11/25/05: On Thanksgiving day I took a longer trip of about 50 miles.  Set to use WAAS, the C340 locked up at exactly tyhe same point as in my previous review, about 7 miles from my home on a major highway.  The unit definitely locks up at this point consistently and I will be informing Garmin.  I did find that turning off WAAS reduces the amount of lockups but I can still get it to lock up with WAAS turned off.  When it does work, the C340 is impressive in its accuracy and display.  The automatic daylight to dark screen contrast is nice.  But I still can't recommend the product because of the instability.  I'll post an update here if I can get a response from Garmin.12/30/05 Update:  Several weeks ago, Garmin released updated firmware for the C340.  I downloaded and installed the firmware update.  Address entry appears to be improved and I have not encountered the lockups previously mentioned since applying this firmware patch.  That said, I still have a hard time recommending the c340 for the price and other minor to moderate issues, but I am happier now that the lockups are gone.5/22/07 Update: Changed my recommendation and rating of this product.  I have gone many places with my Garmin and it is still a solid performer.  Just recently, I went from Orlando to Hampton Roads, VA and the Garmin was very accurate.  One thing I do want to add is that the Garmin likes to use major highways.  Unchecking this feature is not advised as the Garmin will go \"bonkers\" using back roads and even dirt roads to get you to your destination.  You must update the firmware frequently as Garmin continually irons out the bugs in the product.  I still don't think this thing was ready for prime time when it was first sold...too many bugs!  But now, with the latest firmwares and maps, I solidly recommend the Garmin to my friends, family and anyone.

When considering the options, for my car to get a stereo faced GPS unit (the new Panasonic), it was going to be more than I wanted to pay, in the area of $2500 (this including installation, the stereo faceplate for my car (Mazda6)).  That option was unacceptable so I went looking for another option.I chose the Garmin C340 for a few reasons.  First, I'm a gadget freak and it was a new model coming out.  Second, it has a traffic ready option which means if you buy the antenna and pay for the service, it will navigate you around a traffic jam...the only word for that is COOL! (especially since I live in the DC area).  I haven't bought the antenna, so I haven't tried this option.  Third, we travel a lot out of the country, and wanted a unit that could be taken all over the world.  Fourth, Garmin has such a great reputation, that I felt confident in buying a brand new product from them.I received the box two days ago, and took the GPS out for a spin immediately.  I was amazed at how well it worked.  I didn't have a problem with it acquiring satellites in the city at all.  The only problems I did have with the GPS are: 1) that I couldn't input an address until I called Garmin because only two states would appear.  I called Garmin about the problem, and apparently it's a common problem with new units and they had a simple solution for it. 2) The bracket/stand that comes standard is hard to tighten, so for someone with arthritis or bad hands will have a lot trouble fastening the bracket/stand so that the GPS unit does not move when in use on the dashboard. 3) I expected more in the box, it essentially only came with a driver CD, and the GPS unit.All in all, I fully endorse this product.  It's a viable GPS solution for those who don't want to spend a small fortune to get their car into the 21st century.~/~/~/Update\\~\\~\\~I've traveled to several US cities, Canadian cities, and European cities (see posted pictures) and this thing has NEVER let me down.  It loses reception in tunnels and garages, but quickly reacquires satellites upon leaving those places.The complaints I have are that: 1) while navigating, the Garmin will change my zoom perspective when directing me to make a turn, and not return it to my original view, 2) it will not allow you to transfer pre-selected routes from your mapping software (i.e. City Select Europe) BUT it will allow you to transfer Waypoints, which can then be mapped to, and 3) that it will direct you to \"turn\" when you're actually staying straight...which, if I don't have the voice activation going OR I'm listening to music loud, will lead me to make wrong turns.  Other than that, this thing is flippin' sweet!%-% second update (3/15/07):So, I had to send my Garmin in to be replaced; the battery died.  I learned that 1) Garmin has some excellent customer service.  I didn't buy the warranty, and they replaced my unit free of charge - unit and window mount.  I was only without a GSP for 8 days.  And the transferred my saved locations and upgraded the software.  WoW.  Nothing but thumps up.  If I could change my rating to 5 stars, I would based on the customer service.  2) I learned that you must plug the unit into a wall or computer via wall every few months to charge the battery.  If you don't, the battery will lose charge and eventually die.

I really became intrigued and interested in GPS units after a cross country trip from South Florida to Toronto Canada. My boss was kind enough to lend me his nav system, a 2600 Garmin series, not sure of the exact model. My wife and I felt so at ease knowing we had a nav system to keep us guided. This made the trip really relaxing. So I started researching a system for purchase. I checked, googled and yahooed to find out much detail as I could about these products. I looked at the Magellan, the Garmins and the Tom Toms. Based on feedback from this forum, I decided to purchase the C340 for myself. I found the prices were so friendly, I also bought the i3 for my wife. We have loved the units so far. Some folks have griped about accuracy and outdated maps etc, come on, this is to be expected as things constantly change. I am happy with my unit knowing that it will always get me close. No issues so far as I immediately downloaded all software updates available from Garmin's website. The only thing I would change is faster notification of up coming turns, maybe I have to fiddle with the settings so that it notifies you of turns faster.Update: The notification changes depending on how fast you are going, so at faster speeds, like on the highway it gives ample time and more advanced notice for your upcoming exits. So this is not even an issue.Update#2: I am happy to report that the units continue to perform flawlessly. I sometimes use it as a yellow pages, much faster and convenient because it gives you the distance. My wife has really started to use her model now and she does not leave home without. I am lucky that my cell phone and the unit uses the same type of USB Charger, so now I only carry one charger in the car which fits all my devices, blackberry, cell and C340. I simply place a cap on my dash, to cover the unit if I am making a short stop, no one can tell it is on the dash under the cap.I recommended that when you get the unit use it in familiar area so you get used to the way it operates and you will never have a problem.Update #3. Continues to work great. A couple of quirks, it gives you distance to the next major interchange if you are on an expressway, this can be a little confusing, because you are not planning to exit, the i3 does not do that. Instead it gives you distance to your next exit or turn.I was having issues with glare during the day and finally figured out that if the screen is angled slightly upwards the glare is eliminated.The unit did make one mistake last week, on a trip through Orlando, it had me exit and then re-enter I4 for no reason. I had the wife's i3 along for comparison and it did not do that. Seems to be a map error, which I will write garmin about.

Overall this is a fantastic unit that I just couldn't do without.. unfortunately it does still have a few drawbacks.Starting with the good:Fast startup - approximately 8 seconds from when you hit the power button to when you have access to the main menu.Nice, large screen which is easy to use even during the daytime (and switches to another color scheme at night to make it easier to use).Nice battery life - uses internal batteries and charges (or powers off of) a cigarette lighter adapter. This is what I use while in the car and the battery holds a lengthy charge when unplugged from it (between 8 and 10 hours in my experience). There is a slight negative to this which I'll touch on more later on.Straight-forward and easy to navigate. It includes a listing of several businesses in your current area which are sorted by category (Gas stations, hotels, restaurants, Attractions, shopping, parking, hospitals, etc..) - Good for when you're in a new area or don't have a lot of time to cruise around and see what's around you. A \"Browse map\" will show a map of your current location and allow you to see (via icons) what's close by.You can also enter a street address and be taken right there.Like the battery issue, theres also a slight negative to the included directory.Text-To-Speech: My reason for buying this unit over the others. Hearing \"Turn right in 300 yards\" can be confusing if you're in an area with short blocks or multiple streets close to eachother. Text to speech will actually speak the street names to you, telling you to \"Turn right at Main Street\". Great feature I wouldn't do without!The cons:Very bulky unit - While it is only about 3 inches tall by about 4 inches wide, it's about 3 1/2 inches deep. Compared to the higher end Garmins which can fit in your front pocket, this one has trouble fitting in even a wide pants pocket. Since I take mine with me when entering stores (after seeing just how many cars get broken into when theyre sitting in plain sight), it becomes a hassle. I eventually had to purchase a camera-case (Sony LCS-CSD General Carrying Case for Compatible Cybershot Digital Cameras) which holds it perfectly.. but I find that I still have to clip it to my belt loop because of the size of the unit.Internal battery: VERY nice as you dont need to change it, but you're limited to the power it has. If you're without a car-adapter the battery will be dead about 8-10 hours later.. Additionally, these batteries are known to lose their holding power over time (this was an issue with the iPod) - meaning that 3-4 years from now it might only hold for 3 hours.Internal Directory: Another nice feature but since it was preloaded when the maps were created, you'll look up a restaurant or store only to find that it no longer exists. Not a big \"Con\" but you will come across it from time to time.Poor satellite reception compared to new Garmin's: The c340 loses reception when not in the direct open - if you take it in your house, a store, or get stuck in a tunnel you will likely lose connection until you get to the other side. Newer garmins will work perfectly even in these same conditions. Not a huge problem but if you're in a location covered with trees you may also lose connection.---A few other notes:Touch screen and user interfaces are very easy to use.The c340 lacks features like the bluetooth phone connection, MP3 player, traffic (an optional antenna and subscription is required on the c340), movie times and gas prices of the newer units. It's nice to press a button and see the current gas prices of every gas station nearby (in realtime) or what time a movie is starting.. Unfortunately those features are not present on this model. If you can deal without these (as I could), the c340 makes a perfect GPS unit. I do wish that I purchased one of the slim-units to make it more portable but at twice the price, I just couldnt justify it.Pick one up and you'll have a great time with it![UPDATE: July 01, 2007]: Just took the garmin on a short road trip with me. 3 hour drive to a city I've never traveled to - my only preparation being typing the address into my Garmin. As soon as I typed it in, the system estimated my arrival time (6:12). This time did fluctuate slightly during the trip based on how fast I was going. 3 hours later and I arrived at my destination - just a 6 minute difference in time from the estimated time and my arrival time (I arrived at 6:06).The garmin got my there in one piece and showed me around town!The only trouble I had (and this is the first of it's kind that I've experienced in the ~10 months I've owned the unit) was that the display read \"Exit (x street)\" while the voice prompt (and visual map) suggesting continuing on the freeway. I took my chances and stayed on the freeway which turned out to be the correct answer (I'm sure the garmin would have steered me back onto the freeway either way).Can't wait til my next trip!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Wonderful unit with a few drawbacks", "unixReviewTime": 1174608000, "reviewTime": "03 23, 2007"}

Likewise if one hears on 1010 am or wherever of impending traffic jam up along the way, one cannot direct it to pick another route until one is very close to the scene (where it has the limited functinality detour button), by which time it is too late to do anything sensible. My wife has a factory fitted model, which allows you to continually request the system to pick an alternate for any point in its route. a benefit we have availed ourselves of constantly.The hardware is very convenient. It sticks to the windscreen like glue, & is completely portable with battery operated system so no unsightly wires, another plus. On downside, it takes time to calibrate its position if you have moved the car since switiching it off, & is far slower at refreshing than a factory fitted. The lighting is very good.

The sound quality from these headphones is fantastic.  You can pick out the individual voices of the backup singers.  Things like the drummer's brushes sound vastly improved, and many other little details.  I have created mp3s using LAME at the \"insane\" quality setting, 320 kilobits/sec, with optimizations, and I can distinguish subtle sounds in the original stream that are muted or altered in the MP3.  Poor quality recordings, or overly compressed MP3s sound terrible compared to what these headphones are capable of.  I find it most impressive compared to lesser headphones in pieces that have vocals and acoustical instruments.The headphone has an ultra-low impedance, 24 ohms, which means it can be easily powered by portable players, and achieve more than enough volume.  Since a 1/4\" screw-on adapter is included, so this headphone can be used equally well on your portable or your home stereo.  Both the base mini plug and 1/4\" adaptor are gold-plated.  If use this headphone on a portable player with a large disc, you may be tempted to keep your most listened-to recordings uncompressed (or in the FLAC lossless format, for the few devices that support that).According to my research, the headphones have an extremely even response over the whole spectrum.  That means that what you are hearing is pretty close to the original intent when the music  was mixed.  Some users have complained that the bass response is low -- but I think that's compared to headphones / earbuds / in-ear monitors whose bass response is too high.  If you don't like the bass response, simply change the equalizer settings on your unit.The headphone has a closed design, blocking out outside sounds.  This is the best way to go in my opinion, because with outside noise you need to raise the volume higher to achieve the same clarity, and you risk damaging your hearing.  These headphones can be played at low volumes and still sound great.  The only other option for \"closed-ear\" is some of the ear-sealing in-ear-monitors, but the good ones are very, very expensive.  The in-ear-monitors also have the disadvantage that the sounds of brushing the cable, and even sometimes your own breathing and heartbeat, is trasmitted to your ear.The headphone can also be used as a monitor headphone, i.e. to hear what you are recording while you are recording it--that in fact is it's primary intent.  There is basically no sound leakage  so it works very well--also meaning your won't annoy those around you when you listen to music.  I own a Sony Hi-MD (MZ-RH910), which I record voice audio with, and so this monitor ability is very welcome.I find the headphone very comfortable.  Like any closed headphone, it does make your ears warm, but I have not found this to be noticably uncomfortable.  I believe this headphone is suppossed to be more over-the ear rather than on the ear (i.e. like Sennheiser HD 25-SP), but be warned that the opening for each ear is small -- my ears barely fit in them, and I do not have large ears.  From a comfort point of view, I recommended that you try this set on before purchasing them.  I tried mine on before buying and purchased them from a retail outlet.  Another plus for this set is that only one cable comes out of the left side of the unit, the connection to the right channel is through the arch over your head.  Furthermore, the cable drops out about 1 inch from your neck, so it usually doesn't touch you.  I find this greatly preferable to having cables hanging out of both sides of your head that always seem to be brushing you somewhere.  All earbuds, in-ear-monitors, and even many hyper-expensive headsets (i.e. Sennheiser HD 650), have cables coming out of both ears.The Sony 7506 headphone is super-rugged, exceptional quality from start to  finish.The only possible negative I see is the cable -- it's a non-removable, long, thick, heavy-duty coiled cable.  For use on your home stereo, it's great.  But for use outside the home on a digital music player, it is inconvenient, as the bundled coiled cable probably takes as much space as your player.  However, it's not unusable, from the left earpiece there is just enough straight cable to reach down to your waist -- where you can stuff the coiled cable in your pocket or in a case along with your player.  But if you plan on using this mostly on a digital player outside your home, this alone could a be deal buster.  It is also fairly bulky to carry around.  You can probably forget about using this headphone on your bicycle, or while jogging, or anything where you are moving around outside.Overall, this is a very well made set of headphones that will deliver beautiful and pristine sound at a reasonable price.

Again and again, I go back to using the MDR-7506 for all applications from digital video shooting and editing to music recording and studio mastering. Most of the pros I know also use the MDR-7506 when they have a choice--and buy them for use at home too.What makes these the best? First and foremost, excellent reproduction from bass into the high end, with unrivalled \"punch\" and clarity. They are much louder at a given input volume than most headphones, which is important if your are recording in the field and need to hear the headphone monitoring above the ambient sound and the live sound around you. They are comfortable, instantly adjust to different head sizes without any fussing, sturdy and easily repairable, and stowe quickly and easily in the included soft drawstring bag.I do keep a couple of pairs of high-end ($300+) headphones to check as references when mastering music, but honestly I seldom find anything with them that isn't already clear with the 7506es.The only problem I can report is that, even though they invariably outlast other headphones in terms of wear-and-tear, they do get STOLEN more often by my students. Once you get used to the 7506, its hard to go back to using any other headphones that cost less that twice their price.I still dream of someday discovering a comparable headphone set for half or a quarter the price of the MDR7506.

But so far, no problems, so it stays as is.The plugs are the gold type, so less chance for corrosion over time.Good highs and lows for headphones.The best set of headphones I ever had were a pair made by Koss, and sold by Radio Shack called the Pro-60s that were only around $59, but they discontinued those many years ago.  The foams would always wear away into dust after a while too, but when compared to the expensive Senheisers with the yellow foams, everyone I let try mine who had the Senheisers, liked the Pro-60s better and ended up getting a pair too.  (I know I am going to lose a lot of credibility right away with some people when they read the words \"Radio Shack\" but keep in mind these were made by KOSS, and were KOSS headphones.)Don't have a set of those anymore to compare with these, but unlike the Senheisers, that I never liked at all, these Sony 7506 headphones do a great job.And they are real comfortable, which is a big plus when you have to wear them for hours, like you do sometimes in broadcasting.This is the most common set of headphones used in radio and television stations today.From what is available on the market today, I wouldn't get any other set.I have a theory about those complaining about the \"low end\" on these, as to me they are clean and sound just fine.However, I have an idea why some people might be saying what they do, the source they are feeding thier headphones are possibly causing the problem.

The audio response is very well balanced: no piercing highs, no enveloping mids, no muddy/overpowering bass. Every single nuance is represented with pristine clarity, and when people say that you'll hear everything with these headphones, they mean it.To the people worrying about the absence of bass due to these being studio-monitoring headsets, the bass is, without a doubt, there in full presence. If you're used to hearing muddy sounding bass or music drenched in low-end sloppiness, you'll be surprised to hear how warm and how articulately the MDR-7506 reproduces bass, yet still managing to hit the listener with such a convincing punch.The high end is of course a pleasure to listen to. The high notes are crystal clear and do not show any signs of being artificially stressed or represented, giving a very silky smooth sound.As for the midrange? One fear of buying headphones is that you end up with hollow sounding music due to the lack of a solid defined midrange, but the midrange is one more thing to compliment about the 7506's. From prominent male vocals to snares, nothing ever seems overpowered, and yet it manages to fill the space with a full rich sound.Overall, the combination in sound from all the spectrums produces a very unbiased enjoyable harmony to the ears. As I listen to all types of music genres, from ballads to rock, classic to RnB, and pop to techno, I have yet to find a genre that these heaphones fail to reproduce with exceptional fidelity.And did I mention these headphones are very comfortable? I've worn these close to half a day without my ears being fatigued. Many earbuds and headphones have the tendency to make ears hurt/sore after only a short session of listening. I would say I have bigger than normal sized ears and the large-diaphragm design, combined with the very soft leather-wrapped earpads, really helps in making the circumural design (wrapped around the ears as opposed to on top) work well. This also means that sound is sealed off very well, muffling sounds from the outside coming in, and from the music inside getting out. For example, these are the type of headphones you would want to carry with you to public places (bus rides, airplane trips) instead of headphones like the Sennheiser HD595's.Having had these headphones for 1-2 years already, the quality is still as good as when I got them, and I don't doubt that they will be any different for a long long while.Ultimately, with the price tag being conveniently under 100 USD, this is an excellent buy. Even in comparison with higher end headphones, the sound quality for the MDR-7506 is still ranked as the top in my charts, as well as many other people's. If you look closely at professional settings around the world (i.e. studio performances, behind-the-scenes movie sets, & radio stations), as I have started to notice recently, you will see this exact model appear time and time again for a very good reason.Cons:The only con I would like to point out is that the earpads do tend to wear out after prolonged use. Since they are very soft to the skin and thus are made from very fine material, they are subject to wear & tear. Though, replacement earpads are cheap, easy to find, and easy to install. In total, i've only had to replace the earpads once since I got the 7506's, and that's with the headphones going through daily abuse.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best Headhpones - Clear & Rich Sound, Awesome bass response!", "unixReviewTime": 1246233600, "reviewTime": "06 29, 2009"}

Right now I'm listening to a Yamaha stereo with a Blu Ray DVD player the sound (bass,treble and vocals) all sound completely beautiful and clear). Although these headphones are the same as they were about 20 years ago the newer and more modern stereos you can plug these into make a big difference. For one thing with the bass and treble both set in the middle you get a very accurate sound without distorting it in any way.Plus for those of you who like to use extra bass and treble boost you should also own these headphones. The natural sound is flat and even.Like another reviewer stated one of the best things about these headphones is that they sound more evenly toned than most other models and brands of headphones around the same price range.That means you can do your own tweaking with the bass and treble boost when you're just listening to music,tv,video games or movies for entertainment.I must admit when I listen to these for home use I almost always have the bass and treble at the same setting as each other and they sound great even at the flattest setting.The bass,treble and vocals still sound the most even when you don't use an equalizer. Close to all of the other headphones around the 100$ price range I've owned and tried are nowhere near as good at doing that as the Sony 7506.I must say one of my favorite Sony products that I ever had was a pair of 350Hs which are bookshelf speakers but I use these headphones all the time. They give off great volume without being painful to the ears or bothering other people too much when you have them on and listen to them at a pretty loud volume.Best of all when you wear them and listen to music it cuts down a lot of unwanted outside noise leaving just you and your music which is a must for when people are playing music on their speakers and you just want to hear your own.In my opinion these sound best when the I use the Direct Audio option which I believe is another way of saying how the studio engineers intended you to hear the album,movie,video game or tv show on DVD.Most of the time I don't even use an equalizer and I feel that these headphones give off enough great bass and treble sound without one.Try watching a scary movie like A Nightmare On Elm Street or an action packed movie such as The Matrix while listening to them with these headphones and the audio experience is much more intense and better sounding than many headphones around the 100$ price range.Try plugging these headphones into your stereo when playing video games like The Legend Of Zelda Ocarina Of Time,Resident Evil 4 and Super Smash Bros.Melee and you'll feel like you're a part of the action.These are about as universal as a set of headphones can be. Great for all your favorite music. Accurate and clear enough for classical music,easy listening and opera yet can be loud and heavy enough for classic rock,hard rock,rap,grunge,punk rock and heavy metal.From Bach to Black Sabbath, Mozart to Metallica and Celine Dion to Soundgarden these headphones work great with all great music.Like another reviewer said the bass sound these give sound as deep and as close to an  expensive subwoofer sound that you can get for this price.The treble sound is a lot clearer and better than most other headphones around this price range.The vocals come in clearer than pretty much all of the other instruments being these are referred to as the industry standard for television and movies.You do however notice all of the instruments clearer than most other headphones around the 100$ range.I am especially impressed with the way these headphones sound for live concert recordings. When I listen to albums like Kiss Alive! and Nirvana  MTV Unplugged In New York I feel like I'm actually up there close to the artists. For those of you who are accuracy addicts like I am if you're looking to see what it feels like to hear an album,a tape, a record, a tv show,a video game or even a movie the way it sounds in a studio the 7506s are your best bet.Clean crisp sound at an affordable price.These phones are built to last. While the ear pads may wear away you can order more pads online.The only negative thing I can say about these headphones is that while very comfortable they do feel a little awkward.When I wear them I have them adjusted to 11 and they arch right above my forehead.I wish they could sit back on my head a little farther which would make them even more comfortable. That is a minor complaint because these are the nicest fitting headphones I've ever had. They feel nice and snug without being too loose or too tight.These are great headphones and possibly the most popular set of headphones used in American recording studios.These are very popular with people who just want headphones for home entertainment and music listening as well and I'm simply in love with them.In terms of quality and performance the Sony 7506 headphones are a true classic and have withstood the test of time.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A review from a big Sony fan.Best headphones Ive ever had.", "unixReviewTime": 1099094400, "reviewTime": "10 30, 2004"}

I have approximately 20-30 high-end headphones.  I have spent as much as $900.00 for the top of the high-end headphones.  Each set offers different things that are wonderful.The Sony 7506 is no frills.  No leather covered earpads or aluminum fittings.  They fit snugly, but not as constrictive as Sennheiser 600 or 650.  They do not float on your head like the audiophile Audio-Technica models which are excellent.  The earpads fit on the ear rather than surrounding the ear like Audio-Technica.  The phones are closed back and achieve a very good seal as to outside noise.As far as sound, I cannot say that they are flat sounding.  They have an immediate sound stage.  You feel you are on stage with the musicians.  There is no sense of separation from the sources of the music.  The sound is very joyful and dynamic. They are very easily driven by an Ipod.  I have not heard them with a headphone amplifier.  I suspect that a headphone amplifier might make them sound overripe if not on the low gain setting.Often times, I prefer an open-backed headphone because it seems to give you a sound that has more space in it.  I like the more subtle approach, but these headphones do not seem too close.On a technical note, the headphones appear to be made of plastic rather than lightweight metal.  The wires that go to each earcup of the headphones are exposed so that they could be pulled if you do not use them very carefully.  One thing you will note from the Audio-Technica ATH-AD700 (which is approximately the same price) is that the wires to each of the earcups is hidden inside frame of the headphones.  Additionally, I believe (although I am not sure)that the headphone frames of the Audio-Technica ATH-AD700 are metal with metal fittings.  I cannot comment on how long the Sony headphones will last because I have only owned the 7506 for a month or so.  At the same price, you might want to consider the Audio-Technica ATH-AD700 or the Grado SR-80.In short, if you are not a fanatical collector of headphones and only want to purchase one pair, this is an excellent choice.  By the way, by having more than one set of headphones, you in effect have several different stereos--each sounding rather different than the other.  To achieve sound of this caliber from speakers, you would have to spend thousands of dollars to get the quality of sound a listener with good headphones can get from an Ipod featuring huge memory and portability.  Lastly, you will not burden everyone around you in your family with having to listen to the same music you are listening to your music.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Can't beat the performance for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1200614400, "reviewTime": "01 18, 2008"}

NO THANK GOODNESS.However, there is not any 'polishing' of the music, and unless you EQ each disc, in conjunction with your equipment, i don't think you will enjoy long listening periods with these.  You will soon hear things that will drive you crazy.  They are AWESOME for teaching your ears to discern different mixes, frequencies and flavors of the disc, but it will soon wear you out.

This peaky perhaps delayed resonance energy I think might give people the impression that the headphones have better resolution than they actually do.  To me they don't exactly sound smooth up there...kind of crunchy or harsh.  I wish Sony would use better materials for the earpads, since they tend to eventually disintegrate fairly easily from sweat, sun, benzoyl peroxide, or even ocean air.  Cheap enough to replace, though.  While this headphone certainly is a standard piece of equipment used in monitoring microphone feeds, it is not how music was necessarily meant to be heard.  You would never want to do the final mix of a song using this headphone, and I don't think studio users would claim that.  They do adequately cover all the frequencies without distorting, get more comfortable over time, and are extremely durable (besides those earpads).

I've never been as impressed by my V-600's as the Sony MDR-V6 phones that I lost.  The earlier pair seemed trimmer, lighter, with a \"cleaner\" sound--no gratuitous boosting of the bass.  My impression is that, although still being sold, Sony's support for the MDR-V6 is minimal and that their closest equivalent is the MDR-7506, not the V600s.  The 7506's sound less bass heavy and feel less constricting than either the V600s or MDR-V700's.  In fact, the specs indicate an even lighter weight and a shorter cord (best for radio announcing) than the MDR-V6 phones.  And it doesn't hurt that they're available through Amazon Prime--which is not the case with MDR-V6's.  It looks like my confidence in the pair was contagious--it's now practically the only set of headphones we use at our NPR radio station.Don't be surprised if upon first listening to these you're unimpressed.  And be even less surprised if upon exchanging the 7506's for a pair of V600's or V700's your initial reaction is one of satisfaction, even momentary exuberance.  The bass is far more prominent, the sound is fuller, fatter, more engulfing--the overall effect is simply \"heightened.\"  Stay with them for at least 15 minutes, now go back to the 7506's--and don't be too surprised if you completely revaluate your initial impression.  That's all it took for me to realize that Oscar Peterson's keyboard facility was not being accurately represented by the colorful sound of the V600's and V700's.  All of those 32nd and 64th notes in the right hand were overly reverberant and \"doctored\" relevant to the 7506's, causing the piano notes not only to sound overly brilliant but to \"bleed\" into one another.  Returning to the 7506's was like rediscovering \"reality\" and deciding that maybe \"virtual reality\" isn't all it's cracked up to be by today's gamers, audiophiles, and surround-sounders.Heavy bass attracts my interest only when you're talking a 4-6 pound largemouth.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fire your doctor and take the \"natural cure.\"", "unixReviewTime": 1198281600, "reviewTime": "12 22, 2007"}

If you're not already convinced, read on.Most new 7506 owners are awed by their headphones before even hearing them, at least by the packaging. The headphones themselves rest on gently tousled silver silk behind a clear plastic window emblazoned with a large gold \"7506\". The presentation alone gives the potential buyer the feel of buying a giant engagement ring, but the theatrics end once you open the box. Getting down to business inside is a very serious schematic diagram documenting the complete parts and assembly list of the fifty or so pieces that go into making this single pair of headphones, a 1/8\" to 1/4\" adapter (the screw-on type, a must for live use), and a pleather carrying pouch.The 7506s are visually almost an anti-climax to the packaging. The design is very basic and straightforward without any tricks or frills, but simplicity is part of the appeal here. Every detail has been engineered to work simply and simply work. The steel band size adjustment snicks into place confidently at each numbered groove. Both earcups rotate vertically a full 180 degrees on their hinges with ease. The 1/8\" plug has an all-metal casing with a real rubber sleeve, as you'd find on actual pro audio music cables. The more deeply you look into each element of the design, the more you'll appreciate how much Sony also looked into it.Putting on the 7506s is also an easy affair, thanks to their eight ounce weight and modest profile. They're actually small enough that you could get away with wearing them in public, but you wouldn't hear much else - the closed design combined with cushy stuffed vinyl pads and secure, if not tailored, fit means the ambient sound isolation borders on noise-cancelling. The earcups can also be folded upwards against the inside of the headband for portability - so portable in fact, that you could place a folded set of 7506s in a child's lunchbox *with room to spare*.But if ever a good thing came in a small package, it's the big sound of these headphones. Ruler flat response, deep sound stage, and sniper tight accuracy means every aspect of the source signal comes to life and is revealed in full. Bass notes come through with such authority that you find yourself occasionally making note of your feet, to see if you can feel the bass in the floor. Instrument placement is at once obvious - parsing out where each instrument and sound is in a mix is instantly clear. Previously hidden and obscure sounds and passages in various tracks stand out so well that entire songs are made new again. There just isn't any sound that the 7506s can't reproduce exactly as you'd hear it with your own ears.Those of you who like to tailor your sound with extra helpings of bass or volume have also been accommodated - On the low end, using even the most basic bass boost the 7506s can faithfully reproduce subwoofers-in-the-trunk neighborhood-wide bass *in your head*. I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't heard it myself. Volume-wise, a low impedance matched with a high power handing capacity means these headphones are easily driven by an iPod or Walkman, yet can easily achieve volume levels that could liquefy your inner ear without even the implication of distorting. Plainly speaking, whatever you want the 7506s to do, they'll do it with ease.Keep in mind that revealing everything requires a good source. Plugging these into a cheaper portable or poorly EQ'd equipment will quickly make any and all limitations evident. This includes cheap computer audio hardware and low frequency/bandwidth MP3s. Uncompressed file formats suddenly seem a lot more practical when you can hear the constraints of highly compressed MP3s.\"Audiophile\" sites and reviews have had a hard time coming to grips with these headphones. Being that they're a consumer brand product available at any common music store at a fraction of the price of most other high-end models, the \"elite\" image and price tag that goes along with it just aren't a part of the 7506's game. It's reflected in some reviews, some saying they're \"too bassy\", others \"too bright\", but how exactly is this possible if you're using a decent source and the same headphones the musicians/engineers used to create the recording? You're hearing the music exactly as it was heard in the studio, exactly as it was meant to be heard. Only the 7506s can make that promise.If you're creating any kind of recordings and find yourself crossing your fingers that you're hearing it as it's actually being recorded, or just a music lover who feels it's time to hear the music as it was meant to be heard, you're only a hundred dollars away from the Sony MDR-7506.

If you are looking for a really lightweight supra-aural noise canceling headset, then consider the Sennheiser PXC 300 ($150). Finally, if you want noise-caneling ear canal headphones, then the Etymotic Research ER6i's ($85) are for you.The QC2 comes in two flavors: champagne and silver (2005). The older champagne version has a problem with the headband breaking. If the headband breaks during your warranty period, Bose will send you a brand new pair of silver QC2s. The only other major difference between the two flavors is that the silver headphones work with Bose's cell-connect accessory. The cell-connect connects your compatible cellphone (there's a list on Bose.com) to the QC2s and has a mic. I personally don't know why one would need this accessory... but it's a neat add-on. I have used the cell-connect and QC2s with my Motorola E815 with no problems (other than the fact that I wasn't sure how loud to talk).The QC2s shine when worn on airplanes, trains, and public transit. They are also very good in the office to drown out the hums of air conditioning and computers. THEY do not make it completely quiet. High-frequency sounds such as people talking are NOT canceled out.I find the QC2s to be very comfortable. Make sure to test them out before you buy them, because the circumaural design is not for everyone. The headphones come with everything you need--1/4\" and 3.5mm connectors, a great semi-hard shell case, and more. The strap for the case is not included with the silver headphones. The earcups on the headphones swivel to flatten and fit inside the case. An iPod can easily fit inside the case, and an iPod Nano can reportedly fit inside the small clear velcro case that initially holds \"customer courtesy cards\" (which are business cards that you can give to people that ask about your QC2s).Make sure to stock up on AAA batteries for the QC2s. The QC3s use a custom Bose rechargable lithium battery instead. Battery life is good, and a light will blink on the side of the headphones when your battery is low.Overall, I'm very satisfied with my QC2s, and I think other people are too. I even saw someone wearing them while driving! (Don't do that).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great for Planes, Trains, and Automobiles", "unixReviewTime": 1149897600, "reviewTime": "06 10, 2006"}

I spent a lot of time listening to one-sided cell phone conversations, inane chatter, jet engines, train noise and bad music in coffee shops and airport concourses. I purchased the Bose Quiet Comfort headphones right before I departed on a 5 day, 3 city trip.From the moment I put them on I knew this was a breakthrough product. Sure - I noticed something akin to pressure on my ears but that sensation passed in a few minutes. It's just like getting used to wearing a watch - you end up not noticing it at all after a short time. What has not passed is the joy in letting the rest of the world just fall away so that I can get some down time while traveling.Not only was the background noise from the plane's engines gone, but I could actually turn the volume down on my Creative Zen Vision much lower than would be the case with other headphones because the music wasn't competing with the roar of the engines.The same with the volumn while watching movies - I didn't have to crank up the volume just to hear what was being said. I could even hear the dialogue of movies played on my laptop and those played by the airline. I cannot emphasize this point enough - for the first time ever, I could actually hear music and videos without cranking up the volume to the max - saving my ears from damage as well as avoiding dirty looks from my fellow passengers.On my honeymoon, my wife and I both brought along a pair. Being able to distance ourselves from all the background noise really did increase the relaxation factor and allowed us to travel 12 hours each way in relative peace. Speaking of honeymoons - this item would be a GREAT wedding gift. There is nothing worse than to spend your time enroute to some fabulous tropical destination for your honeymoon listening to the kids behind you scream while their father snores away.Even at home, my wife will sometimes wear her headphones while reading. It completely eliminates any noise from the television in the next room.Contrary to what one other reviewer has stated, the sound from these headphones is anything but distorted. I find that I can hear subtleties in music that I cannot hear over my home entertainment system. The fact that I can still hear these subtleties while in a loud environment is an added bonus.You probably will not wear these headphones while in the gym (though I have actually seen people wearing them while on the treadmill at my local gym - the same type of people that wear designer workout shorts). There are also times where you don't need noise reduction. For these times, I have inexpensive headphones. I would not however deduct any points from Bose for making a specialty set of headphones just because they are not perfect for all situations.

There's a slight reduction in sound with the headphones, but no more than with a pair of properly inserted disposable ear plugs from the drug store.  However, when I double up the drug store plugs with the Bose, I get a significant, but nowhere near a \"dramatic\" reduction in sound.Bose invented these headphones primarily for airplanes and that's where they shine.  I never realized how noisy an airplane is, even away from engines, until I put on my Bose headphones and found the noise to be significantly reduced.  The headphones did next to nothing about reducing the noise of the shrieking kid in the seat behind me however.  They mostly work on the airplane engine frequency, which is nowhere near the shrieking kid frequency.  Double plugging with the drugstore earplugs helps far more with noisy children than either alone.BTW, I find these headphones, which are padded at the ears and the top of the head to be quite comfortable for noise reduction headphones.  I have an older pair of noise reduction headphones from a different manufacturer which feel like your head is in a vice.If you're buying these headphones for noise reduction, I only recommend them for airplane engine noise.  I recommend taking a spare pair of charged rechargable batteries with you in case your batteries die in flight.  You can use these headphones to plug into the airplane sound system to watch the movie, but if you're in coach, the airline will generally charge you for using their sound system.In my experience, with noises other than airplane engines, they are only your \"volume reduction to the world\" if you double plug with drugstore earplugs.

This works very well on continuous noise sources like aircraft engines, for example, while still allowing you to converse with your flight partner and hear cabin safety announcements.

Better quality audio, less &quot;white noise,&quot; lighter, fold down smaller (greater portability,) the single AAA battery lasts much longer and fits in one headphone unit - the cable connects to the other.

I foolishly flirted with a relatively inexpensive in-ear version by Panasonic - total waste of money.By reading reviews and road-testing the various products (where possible), I narrowed my choices to Sennheiser PCX300 and Bose QC2. I decided on the Bose, and here's why:1.  Unlike the PX300s, the QC2s have an unobtrusive mic battery setup, one AAA tucked neatly into the right earpiece.2.  The Bose only have one lead, whereas the Senns have two.  Less chance of getting them tangled.3.  The QC2s cover the entire ear, thereby further preventing noise intrusion, and leakage.  I also found this more comfortable than the Senns, which sort of *press up* against the ear.4.  I found the bass response more pronounced with the Bose and, I think, a little louder overall.5.  I also like the hard case that accompanies the headphones. I know it will fit neatly into the plane's luggage compartment on the back of the seat in front of me. There's room in it for the bits and pieces that come with the 'phones and also extra space for my vidpod, possibly an external battery pack.6.  I already own Bose products and know that they are of the highest quality, especially when it comes to innovation in sound reproduction.That about sums it up.  I've purchased the 'phones predominantly to use on domestic and international flights, but I'm slowly getting the feeling I'll be using them a little more often than that.I only bought the QC2s a few hours ago, and literally haven't been able to take them off my head - want to listen to my entire library anew.

It's probably something I'll get used to in time.2)  In-flight, I felt my ears warm - not to the point of discomfort, but it was noticeable.3)  On the positive side, I put the phones on as soon as I was seated, turned the NC on, and immediately felt calmer.  I could still hear some discussion and announcements, but that general din (which you don't really notice until you have the means by which to cancel it) all but disappeared.  I think this alone is a big plus.4)  Listening to and watching my vidpod was an absolute pleasure. I found the sound level more than adequate, and on certain tracks had to actually dial the volume back slightly, especially when watching movies.So I guess the only thing I have to overcome is getting used to perhaps looking different with my *cans* on.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Worth the wait", "unixReviewTime": 1149897600, "reviewTime": "06 10, 2006"}

It could fit in my jacket pockets but I think it will rip my shirt pocket trying to stuff that thing in.I decided to keep it because it did take great pictures.

It is definitely much lighter than the Canon EOS 20D (and thousand dollar less to boot).But there is no question that I had been spoiled by Canon EOS 20D. The focusing was slower, and it took me longer to take shots. But definitely much faster than my Minolta Dimage 7 (5 megapixel) that I paid one thousand dollars at the local Sam's Club several years back.I found that the positive for this camera is that it takes great pictures with AUTO.I found that when I used the zoom lens inside a building with medium light, I did get some blurry shots but the Camera warned  with the shake symbol. It is nice that the camera warns  you. That tells me that instead of zoom, I should physcally come closer to the subject and then take pictures.I found that it is possible to turn off the flash (by changing the setting from AUTO to something else like LANDSCAPE). But invariably you will get blurry pictures in a medium light enviroment unless you take it with a tripod.The other thing that attracted me to this camera vs the other ones was that it used AA batteries.

I have noticed that with my 2500 mAh rechargeable batteries I was able to take quite a few pictures, show off the results to folks on the flippable LCD screen and it was couple months before the battery was totally out. Which was NOT BAD at all!The fact that this camera uses SD chip is also a great feature. SD chip has come down in price trememdously in the past few days. I just got a 4 gig SD chip with 150 X speed for less than one hundred bucks with shipping and tax!!! One could get about 1000 pictures at the highest resolution!!! Ironically, SD chips are now cheaper than Compact Flash for slightly faster speed. I don't know how can they fit 4 gig in that small space...The video option is a Bonus extra for me and I thought it took surprisingly good video considering the size and the lens of the camera. In a dark room, it does not come out well. It needs bright light enviroment. So for a small camera that you can take videos...that is not too bad. Of course it will not be professional looking and all that...for that I have the Canon XL1S. But for special candid moments or unexpected situations, it is great to be able to get a video of something that is viewable on computer or TV.I do like this camera!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great portable digital camera", "unixReviewTime": 1148688000, "reviewTime": "05 27, 2006"}

I figured a Canon camera, with 7.1MP and 4x optical zoom under $250- how could I go wrong.When the camera came I was disappointed with the small size of the screen- only 2\" versus most of the competitors that are 2.5\" and yes it does make a big difference in how the picture looks.  Big deal the lens swivels around, and after a day or so you will get tired of that.  It does nothing to actually help the camera.  And also if you look at the lens from the side it is hazy and lacks color, which is a sign of a cheap screen.Also notice this camera takes four large batteries whereas most of the competition takes only two.  These extra batteries make it almost impossible to fit this camera in your pocket and weigh the camera down.Most importantly I was disappointed with the optics of the camera.  4x zoom should come in clearer than what this camera delivers.  Objects only 30 feet away will come in faintly and will lack crispness.  One should not have to buy overpriced, proprietary lenses to take a good picture.

{"reviewerID": "A2ZCXIZHS191TG", "asin": "B000AYJDD6", "reviewerName": "Fred Anonymous Smith", "helpful": [65, 65], "reviewText": "This is an outstanding small camera. It is difficult to call it a \"point and shoot\" considering the number of advanced options. It has most of the core features offered on even upscale 35mm cameras just a decade or so ago, updated for digital. Regardless, those seeking family shapshots will find it very easy to use (the \"basic\" users guide covers everything), while the more advanced features (covered in the \"advanced\" users guide) will appeal to more serious photographers. In addition to the standard shooting modes (full auto, aperture priority, shutter priority, full manual, and so on), one will find complete control of white balance, numerious pre-programmed color modes along with full color adjustment, the ability to use auxiliary lenses and filters, and more.Picture quality is impressive for such a small camera - better than any 35mm point & shoot camera ever used. Images are sharp, with colors vivid and accurate. Focus and exposure metering are spot on (even more so with spot metering and selectable metering zones available). Lens aberrations (barrel distortion and edge blurriness) are virtually undetectable in \"real-world\" photos. Purple fringing, a problem with some digital CCD sensors, is not a major issue here.The flash is perhaps the weakest point of this camera. Not horrible, but obviously could be better. Like most compact cameras, red-eye with flash pictures can be a problem. There is a red-eye reducing flash mode and the camera has a built-in filter to address this, but neither fully eliminated the problem with all subjects. An external slave flash, such as the Canon HF-DC1 or more fully featured Metz 28 CS-2, may offer some relief in this regard. But, even if one eliminates the red-eye problem, the flash is still too weak, located too close to the lense, and not automated enough - too often resulting in over-exposures, vignetting with close subjects (even more so with the conversion lenses), and not enough light for distant subjects. One is almost forced into existing light photography with this camera, but the results are certainly worth it.The Canon .45x wide angle (WC-DC58N) and 1.7x telephoto (TC-DC58N) conversion lenses are a blast to use. As explained in the \"advanced\" users guide, these require a special lense adapter (sold separately) attached using the bayanet mount hidden under the large metal ring at the base of the primary lense. The ring is removed by pressing silver button on camera body to the bottom right of the lense. These two increase coverage from 24mm wide angle to about 245mm telephoto. However, vignetting prevents the use of the entire zoom range. With the telephoto, for example, vignetting starts just below 80-90mm, limiting use to above that - offering a zoom range with the conversion lens of roughly 180-245mm. The lense adapter also accepts standard 58mm filters, but many (light correction, color effects, and so on) can be simulated in the camera.I did extensive research (magazine and user reviews, as well as several trips to the camera store) before deciding on this particular camera. In that process, I was able to narrow the list of possibles down to six - this camera, the FinePix E900 (weak low light focusing), the PowerShot S80 (strange lens adapter and too easy to accidently turn on), the Cybershot DSC-V3 (discontinued in this market, but still available if one hunts), the Olympus SP-350 (somewhat sluggish performance), and the Pentax Optio 750z (weak viewfinder, weak focusing, and somewhat sluggish performance). None of these other cameras performed especially poorly, which is why they made it into the final selection list. So, even with the minor issues noted, any of them would be a good choice. However, this camera, the PowerShot A620, just seemed to do almost everything well - ultimately making it the best choice in this camera category.Note: Several reviewers here have expressed doubts about the soft plastic door over the USB and A/V connectors. When I mentioned this to a repair tech at a local camera shop, he allowed me to try pulling the door off a store damaged camera (dropped flat on it's face on the hard tile covered cement floor). While I'm sure the door will come off if pulled hard enough, it is a lot tougher than it appears.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Does almost everything well - making it the best choice.", "unixReviewTime": 1150329600, "reviewTime": "06 15, 2006"}

CHARLOT", "helpful": [46, 46], "reviewText": "I purchased my A-620 specifically for use underwater in a Canon WP-DC90 housing. I needed an u/w camera system with both still and video capability that met my $750 budget, and the A-620 with housing was actually $100 less than that, including a 2 gig SD card for $135. As of June 2006, the camera's street price has dropped more than $100 from it's introduction, making it a real bargain if you like it's features. For full techno review, see the reviews in DPREVIEW or DCRESOURCE, but here's my two cents worth:What I like about the A-620:1. Uses good ol' \"AA\" NIMH batteries. I hate proprietary power packs that you can usually only buy mail order or from camera stores at three or four times the cost of a set of AA's.2. Fully point-and-shoot if I just want snapshots or my wife is using the camera (she is a techno-phobe who fears complexity in any gadget). But when I need to be more specific about settings, or the lighting is poor, the camera has full manual exposure and manual focus controls. In normal daylight conditions, Program mode takes very nice pictures. For conditions where I need a lot of depth-of-field, I can use Aperture priority at f7.1 or f8.3. VGA movie mode. Excellent video quality for this camera's price point. The audio quality isn't great - get a real camcorder if you want good sound - but for underwater use audio was irrevelant since I added my own separate music track in post-production. The finished video DVD from my Cozumel dive trip was incredibly good; I would have had to spend many thousands of dollars on professional gear to get any substantial increase in quality of the video image.4. Available waterproof housing for under $175, good to 130' for recreational scuba diving.5. Build quality very good (except for the I/O compartment door), camera's control dial and buttons have a nice feel to them.6. Reliable image quality. Camera rarely makes auto focus or exposure errors in the automatic modes.What I don't like about the A-620:Actually, there is little to complain about. For this camera's very low retail price, it has tremendous capabilities, especially when U/W capability is your primary concern. It would have been near perfect if it had the following features: RAW image output, 28 mm wide angle instead of 35mm.My main gripes: The lens zoom has only 9 discrete steps; I wish there were more steps or better yet a stepless zoom.The lens can not be zoomed while shooting video. According to Canon, the reason for locking the zoom in video mode is to not have the zoom motor's noise on the audio track. For underwater video, this would not be a problem since there is no ambient sound to be recorded anyway (the camera is in a sealed housing). IMO, the video zoom lockout should be something that the user can enable or disable as a menu choice.Summary: Outstanding value for a compact, the A-620 offers a really nice suite of features, very good image quality, and with the addition of the WP-DC90 housing for $160US, it is one of the BEST (maybe THE best) underwater camera systems available for ameteur use. Keep in mind that even a teaspoonfull of salt water leaking through a microscopic defect in a housing seal will usually destroy a digital camera. With the A-620, you lose a $225 camera. With a DSLR, say a Canon D-20, you lose a camera body and lens worth maybe $1800. And as any scuba diver will tell you, there are two types of underwater photographers: those who have already lost a camera to a housing leak, and those who are waiting for their turn to lose one. I highly recommend the A-620 and WP-DC90 housing. Even for use on dry land, the A-620 is a really nice small camera that fits in a jacket pocket. Most photographers that have advanced past the novice level may find the 4x zoom range too limiting, in which case the super-zoom cameras may be more appealing (many brands and models available).For regular use, I will probably replace my aging Minolta 7I with a Fuji S-9000, which is similar in many ways - it uses Compact Flash cards, AA batteries, and has a manual zoom ring. I will then reserve the A-620 for u/w use on dive trips. NOTE: The WP-DC90 housing is specifically fitted for the A-620 and does not fit any other camera.Problems1. Very occasional auto-focus errors even in full daylight, but only perhaps 1 in 200 shots (0.5%). By contrast, my Minolta DImage 7I produces auto focus errors on about 15% of shots.2. The cover for the I/O ports is a soft plastic and doesn't firmly snap into place, it is frequently flopping loose and I suppose it will eventually break off completely.3. The power button is too exposed and it is too easy for it to get pressed by other objects in a camera bag. This could cause damage to the lens or the motor drive that extends it if the camera is tightly fitted in the bag and the lens can not freely extend. This problem can be avoided by storing the camera with the play/record switch in \"play\" position, or of course by removing the batteries (not very convienient).4. Camera flash has pretty good power output for a compact, but produces lots of red-eye in photos of people or family pets (esprcially cats). The in-camera red-eye reduction feature doesn't seem to help much. I guess red-eye can be removed by most PP utilities.I consider these problems to be MINOR and they should not be construed as a reason to avoid this camera. At it's current street price of $225, it is an outstanding value (I paid $350 in October 2005).

Compared to the Olympus C-4000Z which I've used previously, the most striking difference is that the A620 is so fast and easy to control.It takes only a few clicks of the arrow buttons on the back of the camera to set up everything from custom white balance to shutter delay.

The results look just as sharp as those from my Sony Digital-8 camcorder, though of course the A620 won't let you use the optical zoom while recording.  The audio does seem to pick up a hum from the camera itself.The camera's sensor resolution is about 7MP, and the optics must be good: 5x7\" prints (from a Canon i960) show excellent detail.  I haven't yet tried printing at 8x10.I've yearned for a digital camera which would produce the levels of shadow detail one sees in an Ansel Adams print -- the kind of detail that draws the viewer in ever closer until his or her nose is almost on the paper.  I'm just getting started with the A620, but for small prints and low ISO settings it looks like it could do the trick!The A620 uses AA batteries.  Pick up a set of NiMH batteries and a recharger (the camera comes with 4 Panasonic alkaline batteries) and you'll be all set.I'm not sure how quickly the batteries drain.  So far I've gotten nearly 100 photos and a couple of minutes of video from a set of 2000 mAh Radio Shack NiMH batteries, charged once.The camera comes with a 32MB SD card.  You can't get very many high-resolution photos on such a tiny card.  (And I think you could fill it with less than 30 seconds of video.)  I bought a 512MB SD card, which should have room for about 150 photos.  I'm not sure how much Motion-JPEG video it will hold.The included USB cable works without a hitch.  The A620 supports USB 2.0, so it transfers photos and movies quickly.  However, the plastic door which covers the camera's USB port is flimsy, and it interferes with the camera's wrist strap.  A separate USB 2.0 SD card reader would probably be more durable.A lens adapter and accessory telephoto and wide-angle lenses are available for the A620.  I've ordered the lens adapter and a 58 mm rubber lens hood, which I hope will let me take glare-free photos through the side window of my airplane.  The adapter is threaded, so it should also accept polarizing filters.The A620 will fit in a coat or vest pocket.  It will even fit in a shirt pocket, but it'll cause a significant bulge -- and a sag: it's pretty heavy :)  If you want a pocket camera you might want to consider another model/brand.This was a gift, but I think it's amazing that you can get so much camera for less than $400.Cons: small included SD card, flimsy USB adapter cover, some audio hum in movies, may be too large for some tastes.Pros: fast, easy to control, sharp focus, great detail, good movie quality, AA batteries, lens accessories, great price.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fast and flexible", "unixReviewTime": 1135900800, "reviewTime": "12 30, 2005"}

I have not noticed any purple fringing.  The barrel distortion at wide-open can be seen if you look for it, but is not noticible in telephoto (this is typical of all telephoto cameras)  It is fast, especially when using the continuous shooting feature.  I have been able to get good pictures of the kid's basketball activity at ISO 200 in a fairly dark gym without the flash by using the continuous shooting.  This model has a huge advantage over the 540 because it has 4 AA batteries instead of two.  As a result, the flash powers up quickly and allows you to take shots without waiting for 10-20 seconds.  It also seems to last forever with 2400 mAh ni-mh batteries.  The LCD display is easy to see indoors and out and has one of the best features of this camera, something that all digital cameras should have.  Being able to rotate the display so that you can hold this camera over your head and over the crowd and still see what you are shooting is very useful.  Point and shoot automatic mode works great, but I usually use the A, or aperature priority mode.  There is visible noise in the images at ISO 400, but it's a good thing to have when shooting in dark places where other cameras won't let you get a shot at all.  The flash is positioned off to the side enough that you won't always get red-eye, but not enough that red-eye won't be an issue in some of your pictures.  (Photoshop Elements works very well for eliminating red-eye)This camera has a mode where you can take a series of pictures for a panaramic shot and then stitch the images together later.  It is EXTREMELY useful and if this is something you do, you will be ecstatic about it.

I do believe canon did a great job following up on the A95.  However, what i am very dissapointed in is the construction of the camera.  Notice that most digi camera under 250.00 do not offer 7 Megapixles.  that is reserved for the higher priced cameras.  The reason canon was able to do this is simply in the body construction.  PLASTIC - and alot of it.  Its flimsy feeling plastic.  the A95 had a much more sturdy feel than the A620 especially in the pop out LCD.  the cover for the ports on the camera (USB, Power...) is very poorly designed.  Its a rubber/plastic type piece that is made to fit over the ports but never seems to want to stay - theres no latch or way to secure it.  The A95 had the ports scattered all over the camera, which I liked, it allowed me to have more than one cord plugged into the camera without trying to shove them into one small space all together.  the rubber piece covering the A95's ports were alot more effective.  I have No idea why they decided to go with the SD memory type instead of sticking with the compact flash.  that just boggles my mind.  Anyhow...Performance wise the A620 reminds me very much of the A95.  the menus are familiar and the options are a plenty.  I like being able to control how the camera focuses, where it focuses and the grip/LCD combo makes it easy to take interesting angle shots where as other cameras have the LCD fixed on the back of the camera (how are you going to take that myspace picture without a mirror or flip around LCD screen...HMMm???).  The image quality is what you'd expect.  Im not sure if the images Look Better but u can certainly zoom closer into them without getting any pixles.  I would say it hosts about the same amount of colors.  speaking of colors..the \"my colors\" option on the camera is pretty neat.  Change any color to another or accent any color you want.  Now you can also set your own white balance (an advanced feature only enthusiests would want to use)...im tired..i have nothing else to say...If you are an enthusiest with a very limited budget I wouldnt look further than this camera.  theres no two ways about it.  its an amazing price for a VERY versitile camera (most digi's arent even this versatile untill you get to the SLR range.)", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "A620 the new A95??", "unixReviewTime": 1153872000, "reviewTime": "07 26, 2006"}

I've used it with a EOS 20D (1.6x crop), 5D (full frame) and 5DMkII (full frame).  This is the lens that stays on my 5DMkII body most of the time.  Why?1.  The focal length makes it ideal for landscapes, portraits and general action shots.2.  At f/4 it is fast enough for the above, but is not too heavy like an f/2.8 lens, and balances well on the body.3.  Image stabilization is good for 2 stops, Canon advertises 3, but 2 in real-world situations.4.  Sharpness and color contrast is beautiful from this lens. I've had prints made from shots that I was casually taking without much thought in composition, and they've turned out great. The color is one of the best I've seen from most any lens.5.  Sometimes, you have to travel light, and when you can only take a single lens, this lens is the one because of 1-4 above.6.  Robust and well built. I've used this lens in dust, light rain and outdoor conditions in heat and cold without fault.There are drawbacks to this lens:1.  There is barrel distortion throughout the focal length on a full-frame body, but is not noticeable unless you're at 24mm or 105mm, more so at 24mm. This I believe was a design comprimise by Canon.2.  On a full-frame body at 100% crop, you will notice some loss of edge sharpness at f/4.  This is not a problem when you want edge sharpness for landscapes and typically shoot at f/8-f/16.3.  Canon sells these like hotcakes, and you can get one that has been banged around due to shipping or mis-handling.  Canon will calibrate this lens within the 1st year free of charge to make it as sharp as possible.Overall, I don't think Nikon or Sony has anything like this.

However, I couldn't get past the dust issues that users were reporting with it - not at its price point. Furthermore, the lens is digital only, which seemed a major limitation if I ever went full frame. (Of course, the FF dream seems rather out of reach in hindsight.)I even tried the amazingly priced Tamron 17-50mm/2.8, but the build and image quality compromises were too much for me.The real challenge therefore came down to the 24-70/2.8. Judging by my informal survey of lenses used by photographers on Popular Photography, the 24-70 was a clear choice. However, two things worked against it for me. It was much heavier than I thought I would be able to handle for a full day, and the extra speed would very likely be offset by this weight compounded by a lack of IS. I'd be sacrificing sharpness due to camera shake, especially when hand-holding this lens without the assistance of IS.The 24-105mm/f4 seemed the best compromise. I was told by my professional photographer friends that I'd not even notice the trade off of image quality and that I'd come to appreciate the versatility of this lens. Thankfully they were right.I absolutely love this lens. Even with the 1.6x crop factor, this lens is wide enough for indoor shots, and the IS has been undeniably helpful. The images are sharp, with awesome colors. They have an almost 3-D like quality about them! Throw in my Speedlite 580, and the f4 is no longer as limiting as it would seem. I've never complained about its weight even after carrying it around for days. Its build quality is simply amazing - it is literally built like a tank and its zoom and focus rings are smoother than ever.If you're starting out in digital photography, I'd strongly recommend that you ditch the kit lens as soon as you can, and start off with the 50mm/1.8 prime (the nifty fifty), this 24-105mm/f4, and a Speedlite 580. This combination not only provides the best bang for the buck but also provides the best all-round kit.Side note: I am of the camp that believes that the lens is more important than the camera.

I purchased a Canon 70-200mm f/4 zoom lens and completely fell in love with it. On the APS-C format it's equivalent to a 112-320mm zoom with superb edge-to-edge contrast, sharpness, and color rendition. I was so hooked on this \"L\" glass that I yearned for the equivalent quality in the wide-normal range. First I purchased Canon's 24-70mm f/2,8 (via internet auction). I got a very good copy and yet it didn't deliver that \"wow\" factor that I got when I first started using the 70-200. It also seems very heavy for the range, and the lack of IS makes it seem outdated. I have the EF-S 15-85mm for my APS-C and that is a very sharp and light lens that has great IS. The 24-70 should have exceeded that lens in IQ, being \"L\" glass and all, and yet it did not. I put the 24-70 back up for auction.Enter the 24-105mm f/4 IS. The image quality is nearly the same as the 24-70, perhaps a teeny bit less sharp and having more distortion at the wide end. It has that extra 35mm on the long end. The IS means I can get cleaner shots hand-held than with the 24-70. All in all, it's a perfectly functional and versatile lens, I prefer it to the 24-70, and yet I find that I rarely use it.First of all, just like with the 24-70mm lens, the image quality just doesn't give me that ZING that I get from the 70-200. The two lenses share some focal range, and at the 70 and 100mm lengths the 70-200 totally blows away the 24-105. At the \"normal\" range of 50mm, my humble Canon 50mm f/1.4 has considerably better color and contrast, not to mention better low-light capability. That leaves using this lens in the wide angle range of around 24-45mm, and in this range I find the image quality to be just, well, average.When I want a wide view, I usually switch to the interesting Sigma 28mm f/1.8 prime lens. Its image quality may be no better than this lens, but it offers a much wider aperture and also a very close focusing distance. The close focusing distance is something I really utilize because I do a lot of nature photography and I like to completely fill the frame with my subject, such as a flower. The wider aperture gives me more versatility for playing with depth of field.The Canon 24-105mm f/4 lens is an extremely well built lens that does it all but doesn't excel at any particular focal length. My EF-S 15-85mm lens delivers a similar FOV for APS-C, has better IQ, and it doesn't even carry the renowned \"L\" designation. I am still looking for a wide angle zoom for full-frame format that delivers killer image quality in the same league as the 70-200.So I give the lens three stars due to the disappointment factor. I'm thinking I may have to just sell this and several other lenses to fund the purchase of the exotic TS-E 24mm f/3.5L II.To repeat: I really wish Canon would deliver a wide/normal full-frame zoom that delivers images as amazing as their 70-200mm lenses.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Why can't Canon make a wide zoom as good as their 70-200mm lenses ?!", "unixReviewTime": 1316304000, "reviewTime": "09 18, 2011"}

The zoom range, from medium wide-angle to medium telephoto, certainly makes this one of Canon's most versatile \"L\" series lenses. There are professional reviews from TheDigitalPicture.com and DPReview.com that present all the technical details, so I won't spend time going over them here; my review will just be my own reasons to buy this lens and why I like it so much.1. Build quality.  Simply superb, as one expects from an \"L\" lens.  The zoom and focus rings are silky smooth.2. Optical quality. Very sharp throughout the zoom range.  Not quite as sharp as my 70-200 f2.8L, probably due to the extra two lens elements for the Image Stabilization system (my 70-200 is the non-IS version).  Color rendition and control of distortions are both excellent.3. Weight and size: Since this lens has image stabilization and a USM focusing motor, it is somewhat bulky, but the weight is not objectionable, and the beautiful \"feel\" of this lens in your hand more than makes up for the weight.4. Speed: As an f4 maximum aperture lens, it is a full stop slower than the 24-70 f2.8L USM, but if you don't need the extra DOF of the f2.8, this lens is $1200 less expensive.Conclusion: Simply put, the 24-105 f4.0 IS USM is arguably the single most versatile lens in Canon's \"L\" series lineup. True, it is substantially more expensive than \"regular\" lenses of this size range, but if you have a Canon camera body with 18+ megapixel resolution, you will not be getting the image resolution quality from the camera that the sensor is capable of if you are using a $150 \"kit\" lens.  Another reason to go with \"L\" series, even if your current camera is a one of Canon's lower end Rebel models, is that all of the \"L\" series lenses use the EF full-frame mount.  This means that if you decide to upgrade someday to a Canon full-frame camera like the 5D, 6D, or 1D, you will keep your \"L\" series lenses - no need to buy new ones!

About four years later I have sold all my original purchases.  The Canon EF 28-135mm was my most used lens, and I still had it until March 2006 when I replaced it with the Canon EF 24-105mm IS f/4L.Being an L lens, the dust and moisture resistant construction of the Canon EF 24-105mm IS f/4L is sturdy.  The lens consists of eighteen elements in thirteen groups including one Super-UD glass element and three aspherical lenses to minimize chromatic aberration and distortion.  With a standard twist zoom focus, this lens permits for auto or manual focusing depending on how the switch is set.Some of the earlier lenses had an issue that caused lens flare.  This issue was resolved quickly with a recall.  If the control number located on the back cover of the lens begins with a UT and the following number is less than 1,000, then the lens is affected and should be sent in for repair.The Canon EF 24-105mm IS f/4L lens is compact measuring 5 inches long and lightweight weighing in at about 1.5 lbs/670g, and accepts 77mm filters.  Be sure to get agood quality UV haze filterto protect the front lens element. Not only do I see this as a good practice, Canon recommends doing so on their site as well.  The f/stop ranges from 4 - 22. The closest focusing distance is 18 in/45 cm. In addition, the lens has a USM drive mechanism for optimum AF performance, and the pulse control diaphragm (EMD) ensures precise aperture control.The IS system is composed of a pair of gyro sensors to detect vertical and horizontal motion and a microprocessor that compensates for it by shifting special lens elements in parallel with the perceived movement. It is recommended that the IS be off when shooting on a tripod. I have used the IS on myBogen 3231 monopod with legssuccessfully. A monopod is not as stable as a tripod though, with or without the legs. Using the IS, you can obtain sharp pictures three stops below where you normally would. This is a huge advantage in dim light or places where flash is prohibited. Just keep in mind, the IS attempts to eliminate camera movement, not the movement of the subject being photographed.A distance scale ring sits below the focus ring. Turn the distance scale ring all the way to the left and you are set for low magnification close-up photography. Turn it to the right and you are able to set for infinity compensating for changes in temperature as necessary. The distance scale includes figures in red as an infrared index to use when shooting black and white infrared film. Shooting infrared is not available on all cameras. If this feature is a must, make sure this lens is compatible for infrared photography on your camera body.The Canon EF 24-105mm IS f/4L includes a 1 Year US Warranty, the front & rear lens caps, theLP1219 soft pouch, and theEW-83H lens hood.  The hood will decrease chances of lens flare and increase metering accuracy. If you use filters, Canon recommends against stacking.The Canon EF 28-135mm lens is similar in build a little shorter and weighs a couple ounces less.  Of course the Canon EF 28-135mm has a wider focal range.  Both lenses have single mode IS capabilities, and are good walkabout lenses.  Having used the Canon EF 24-105mm IS f/4L the difference in weight and length is hardly noticeable.  The shorter focal distance is not missed, and I have a constant f/4 through out the focal scale unlike the Canon EF 28-135mm with a 5.6-36 on the long focal range.  The images using the Canon EF 24-105mm IS f/4L is sharper and clearer than those using the Canon EF 28-135mm.If the Canon EF 24-105mm f/4.0L IS lens' price is not a problem, this is the lens to get. Otherwise purchase and enjoy the28-135mm IS lens.  The great thing about Canon lenses is they tend to hold their value.

There's nothing better if you want to carry camera and lens about and get a variety of shots in the range from wide angle to short telephoto.  It's difficult for lens designers to make all the compromises necessary to have a lens go from wide angle to telephoto, and have a max focal length over four times the widest focal length, but Canon has done a good job here.  The image stabilization works excellently when hand held (it cuts image quality if you use the stabilization from a tripod, though).  The f/4 maximum aperture cuts the size and weight down quite a bit.  Image quality is excellent for a zoom from about 30mm up to 90mm, good from 90mm to 105mm, and tolerable from 24 to 30mm (getting better in the 28 to 30mm range).  As expected, image quality is best stopped down to about f/8, but is still good wide open at f/4.I can't say the lens has major flaws, but relative weaknesses are the wide angle performance, and the f/4 maximum aperture.  The lens is not fast enough for shots of moving subject indoors.  For stationary subjects, the image stabilization lets you take shots with slower exposure times than you'd expect, but stabilization won't do anything to improve a moving subject.Build quality is excellent as expected, but the lens is quite compact and light, much better than the 24-70/2.8 zoom that is its obvious rival.Also, if you are after the absolute maximum image quality, prime lenses will do better than this lens in the normal and telephoto range (35 to 105).  My $75 50/1.8 lens far outshines this one in sharp, crisp imaging.  Zooms that don't have to accomodate both wide and telephoto focal lengths will also outperform this one--My 70-200/4 lens is much sharper and more contrasty, and even my 16-35 lens outperforms this one in the 24-28mm range (the 24-105 does do better from about 30-35mm, though).  All these things aren't surprising, and they are no reason to condemn or even criticize the 24-105.If money isn't a major concern for you, and you want a superb compromise lens, this is the one to pick.  The only lens that can hold a candle to it is the old 28-135 IS zoom.  If you get that one, you'll get inferior image quality and much less effective stabilization.

It has an ultrasonic motor drive (USM) for fast focusing, image stabilization (IS), and a very versatile focal range that covers wide angle to mid-telephoto on a Canon 5D and respectable 38mm to 168mm (1.6*24 ~= 38, 1.6*105 = 168) focal lengths on cameras with crop sensors, like the Canon 7D, the Canon Rebel series, and cameras with APS-C sensors (1.6x crop factor).Its only downside is its f/4 aperture limitation. On the upside, it has a constant f/4 aperture (i.e. the f/4 aperture setting can be maintained across all focal lengths).- SharpnessThis lens is sharp across all focal lengths. I haven't noticed any degradation in image sharpness on either the 24mm or the 105mm end. However, the lens is sharpest between f/8 to f/11. Outside of this \"sweet-spot\" (i.e. below f/8 or above f/11) shots of distant objects are *noticeably* blurrier. (See uploaded images on the product page for a comparison of images shot with different f-stops.)For relatively close subjects, however, the difference in image quality across f-stops is a lot less perceptible - that's good news if you're using this lens for portrait shots and plan on opening up the aperture for a bokeh effect.- Chromatic Aberration (CA)The lens assembly uses Ultra-low Dispersion (UD) glass (reserved for Canon's best lenses), so chromatic aberration is minimal, even in bright light (where it's barely noticeable or imperceptible). In more even lighting, this lens shows absolutely no signs of chromatic aberration.- Auto-Focus (AF)The auto-focus is real snappy. Thanks to its ultrasonic motor (USM), it brings objects into focus in a fraction of a second. In the AI Servo mode, the focusing mechanism is very responsive for bringing even very fast-moving subjects into focus. However, as with all lenses, the auto-focus inevitably has a bit of trouble in (i) lowlight conditions and (ii) with surfaces that lack texture or contrast.- Image Stabilization (IS)The image stabilization is amazing. In my book, image stabilization is a must for a lens to be truly called a \"walk-around\" lens. For the times you don't have your tripod with you, the IS on this lens will prove very invaluable for helping you steady your shots, especially at the 105mm end! (It helps to bear in mind, too, the rule of thumb: the shutter speed should be at least as fast as the reciprocal of the focal length.)- Internal Focus (IF)The Internal Focus is a big plus, especially for landscape photographers who use a circular polarizer (also known as a polarizing filter). With Internal Focus, the barrel on which the polarizer is affixed doesn't turn and throw filter out of adjustment, so it saves you from having to readjust the filter after the subject is brought into focus.- BuildThis lens simply oozes quality. There's a good heft to it but it's not too heavy. Both the zoom ring and focusing ring turn very fluidly. The zoom ring is tight enough to prevent zoom creep.- Alternatives You Might Be ConsideringCanon EF 24-70mm f/2.8L USM: The EF 24-70mm f/2.8 has a constant f/2.8 aperture, but alas, it has no image stabilization, which is a real shame. The lack of image stabilization is definitely a deal breaker for most people, including myself.Canon EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS USM: The Canon EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 is an equally popular lens. (Note: it has an EF-S, not EF mount, so it's not compatible with the 5D. It's compatible all other bodies, such as the 7D, the Rebel series, and other Canon DSLR's with crop sensors.)With the 1.6x crop factor taken into consideration, this lens has focal lengths of 27-88mm. In terms of image quality, the 17-55mm f/2.8 is on par with the 24-105mm . It, too, uses Ultra-Low Dispersion glass. The only downside is it's not weather sealed (which is not a concern for me). If you don't mind forgoing \"reach,\" I would highly recommend the 17-55mm f/2.8, which is one of the best low-light lenses you can buy. I use it for landscape and portrait, and it's my walk-around lens of choice.---The quality of this lens is top-notch and definitely worth the money. It offers a very useful 24-105mm focal range without compromising on sharpness. The only limitation is the f/4 aperture. If this is not a concern for you, this lens is definitely worth consideration.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Well Constructed Lens That Delivers Exceptionally Sharp Photos", "unixReviewTime": 1336521600, "reviewTime": "05 9, 2012"}

I already have alot of expensive paper weights. So, what make me buy the Z22 is primary the price and the use of flash memory in this unit. I can finally store all my phone numbers in this Palm without worrying that my numbers will be gone when the battery runs out (I hope). Another thing I like the Z22 is the size and the shape. It is a perfect size for my pocket. The screen is kinda \"sink\" into the case. So, the screen is kinda protected inside my pocket. The screen is smaller than the other models but it is bright. I am so surprised that I can read the screen so clearly. Another thing I am surprised is that it comes with a database program called Mobile DB. It comes with alot of different ready-made databases. This is the most useful program for the Z22 beside the games I download from the web.To sum it up why the Z22 is not another gadget:1) Price2) Size3) Useful Database ProgramWhat make it only 4 stars:1) The Palm Desktop won't work well with Windows NT/2000 or XP Professional (must be admin to use it. good luck if you want to use it in your office)2) The power button doesn't have a little pit/hole for me to use the styli to push the power on.3) Graffiti 2 is bad. (need 2 strokes instead of just 1.

I received my replacement handheld less than a day later and I've had no more problems so far.With that said, there's a lot to love about this little guy...First of all, the obvious: what a great price! As a student, I was on a budget and only wanted something to replace my old-fashioned agenda and various unorganized papers, schedules, etc. It gives me all the features I need at a price that's beyond reasonable. I've always thought buying cheaper electronics almost always results in problems, and while I see that other reviewers experienced some and I received a defective model at first, this appears to be a very stable, useful device. Basically, it is what it is. It's not trying to be an mp3 player, a video player, or any other kind of portable media device. Personally, I know I don't need the extra features of PDAs that cost 100s of dollars more, because I already have devices that do those things.Aside from this, it's very easy to use. I had never even picked up a Palm handheld before and after I charged it up I messed around with it a bit and was able to figure out everything I wanted to do. The setup is very straight forward, syncing is easy, and even adding software is a breeze. While I'm pretty experienced with electronics, I imagine even someone who has no experience would have no problems setting up and using this device.And from a less technical standpoint... you have to love the Z22's design. I love how stylish it looks in the little rubber case I got for it. It's compact, super cute, and fits nicely in your hand. The screen isn't too big, but it's definitely not too small. I feel like it's a comfortable size and weight to take anywhere with you, without sacrificing anything. Some might feel the screen size is on the small side, but I really think it doesn't need to be any bigger. And though it's something that a lot of people might overlook, the buttons on this thing are great. I've had a lot of devices with buttons that are too flat or small and sometimes don't respond when you push them(because it's a mission to do so), but I can't see that being a problem with this one.Overall I'm very happy with my Z22 so far and if I don't have any problems like I did in the beginning, I can see using it for a very long time.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great product, perfect price.", "unixReviewTime": 1146873600, "reviewTime": "05 6, 2006"}

You should care because 1) the Z22 is slow and frustrating to use beyond simple datebook and addressbook operations, and 2) it crashes often, and 3) I had lots of problems with Hotsync on the Z22, whereas my old Palms never had a problem.

I use both Palm and Pocket PC but I tend to prefer Palm for everyday PDA needs.  But the z22 is a disgrace to the Palm brandname.  The processor is low-quality and low-speed, and the low-resolution screen goes blank outdoors (i.e., virtually unuseable).

I wanted something that was within $100, able to handle all the lists, tasks and ical content but in color. The Z22 seemed to fit that bill and the specs seemed pretty impressive compared to my current Palm V. However, I was very dissapointed with both the screen size and display resolution. Don't get me wrong, the color is an improvement and certainly aids in color coded organization but the major problem is the way this device displays it's pixels information. I work in the Computer Animation field, so I know a whole lot about how LCD and CRT displays work. This product's display is poorly manufactured. There are pixel scanline issues (for a lack of a better description) with this model that make your eyes tired at the onset. If you look at the default photo #2, you will immediately see what I am talking about. There are these rows of moving pixels that are very bad for your eyesight ( and could cause headaches). You will not notice it on the menu bars until you adjust the contrast settings.I called support and after finally convincing them to pick up the darn pda and look for themselves, they admitted to seeing the same moving pixels. They said to return it as a defect but how can it be a defect if they see it themselves? Anyhow, I love Palm but if you are going to use this product on a daily basis, then I would highly recommend going with a better model until they improve this model. One star for a major blunder in their display technology and add a star because everything else works properly and because I like Palm.UPDATE: I have since purchased the Palm Tungsten E2 Handheld.

Although you can't surf the internet with it, I wasn't needing a mini-hand-held computer.  I needed something to organize all of my addresses, phone #'s, etc...plus schedule all my tasks, meetings, lists, etc...  It does all these plus it has tons more useful functions. It has plenty of memory for what I need and holds a lot of data.  I teach Classical Guitar and I schedule all of my student lessons on it.  It also will remind in advance of something important coming up.  I love the game \"Scrabble\" and have downloaded that onto it.  My Palm Z22 is really a great tool and I sort of nut up when I think I have misplaced it!  It's pretty easy to use so I recently bought my husband one too.  I only had one problem with it - once it wouldn't turn on but a simple press of it's tiny reset button fixed that and no data was lost.  I'm left-handed so using the instant write function is awkward for me but I can still see how righties would like it.  I mean it when I say I have used it a lot - it gets a terrific daily workout from me and it still shows no signs of malfunctions. I never bought a case for it but it's pretty tough already being encased in molded plastic.  I put the plastic film on the screen and it's never needed replacing yet.  I highly recommend buying one if you don't need to use it like a computer.  You can download programs and games onto it from the Palm store of which there is a humongous selection.  Also, it's battery has a long life between recharges and it recharges really fast.  I can go for days without recharging despite playing 15+ games of scrabble at one time.  It's front is mainly screen with a simple toggle button below which is very streamlined and easy to use. It comes with a program to load onto your PC so syncing it everyday to back up new data is quite easy and fast.UPDATE:It is now March 7, 2008 and I am STILL USING my Z22!

I tried the install via the usb port on Macintosh System X and Windows XP formats. The installation program pulled all my old palm info into the Z22; memos, contacts, calendar and task functions were all maintained in the upgrade.  Some of the older applications were not compatible with the Palm 5 OS on the z22.  Most of the problems apps were old games that I was not that concerned about.For under $100 dollars, I'm very impressed with the following;1) colors are bright and reading the screen is easy in light or dark settings.2) I currently have 17.5 mbytes memory left on the z22 after the upgrade.  In the PC world, this is very little memory, but for a Palm environment this is a lot of entries.  If I was concerned about using mp3's, video, doc, or Excel files on a palm format, I would consider another device.3) The battery lasts a long time.  I once used a Palm M515 color palm and it needed recharged a lot more than the Z22 does.

I'm a stay at home mom with plenty of responsibilities to take care of. I never realized how helpful (and how enjoyable) this tiny device could be even for my home life.I understand that this is a basic featured (but still fabulous) PDA without all the fancy bells and whistles - that is absolutely fine for me. All the bells and whistles just add up to distraction for me. This properly featured yet powerful Z22 helps keep me focused on the tasks on hand.I love that it's attractive and diminuitive. It easily goes everywhere with me. I just wish I could attach a wrist strap. I do keep mine in a protective Flexicase, which has worked out great for my needs.I LOVE that the Palm Z22 can be used as a e-book reader. The Palm Software CD comes with the E-reader software you can load onto your PDA if you want it. By far, it is my most favorite program on my PDA. Now wherever I go, whether I'm across the house or outside my home, I keep a library of books with for me to read.I love how I can write down my thoughts at anytime. The Graffiti 2 handwriting recognition program is quite easy to learn and, when in a pinch, I can alway easily use the onscreen keyboard. Overall, very easy to use. The amazingly easy-to-use touchscreen technology makes these PDAs a gem.The internal battery in the Z22 lasts a long time and quickly recharges either by using a wall plug or when synching with the PC. Palm includes a power-off feature which will shut off the Z22 automatically unless you purposely deactivate it when you turn it on. It also shuts off after so many minutes of inactivity. No worries about it accidently turning on or forgetting to shut it off draining precious battery power. So when I'm taken away from my task because of my toddler or other family necessity, I don't worry about the power draining.The included Palm desktop program also makes it easy to keep my Z22 updated. No grievance there. The hotsync feature sometimes doesn't always connect the first time, but it's not a consistent problem. The desktop program also is programmable for different users of different palm products. So while I can use it for my Palm Z22, I can also use it to program my young son's M100 PDA without our files getting crossed. (I'm getting him started early - laf! Plus they're cheap and work great.

I'm not always crazy about the resolution, but again, I got my Z22 to be my PDA workhorse, not a movie theatre.I have absolutely no regrets getting my Palm Z22.

I was a little nervous because many of the reviews were less than flattering.  However, I have been pleasantly surprised.  This is my fourth Palm PDA.  Previously I have owned a Palm V, a Palm 515 and a Palm Tungsten T3.  The TX is head and shoulders above any of the others.  I have used it for a month now and have not had to reboot the device a single time.  The battery life is excellent and the screen is easy to see under almost any lighting conditions.  The wireless internet access is very easy to use, although the screen size creates some limitations as you might expect.  I have found it to synchronize well with Outlook and the Palm software.  The charging cable snaps in place, so there should be no problem with it not charging.  I did purchase an accessory docking station which comes with a variety of plug-ins for the charger so it can be used all over the world.  My only little complaint is the removal of the home icon from the screen and replacing it with a button on the front of the case.  This is not a major problem, but it is a change that I have yet to fully get used to.

Color screen is bright and works well. It shows videos and photos without any problems. It has a strong metal-like hard plastic body and is solid. The body and screen are much nicer than my previous Palm, a Zire 71.A multimedia machine. The ability to use an SD card with up to 2 gigabytes of storage has turned the TX into a portable multimedia device that rivals the ipod. When I purchased the TX, I picked up a 512 meg SD flash card. As SD card prices have declined, I bought a 1 gig and most recently a 2 gig card. I have filled them up with mp3, jpeg and mpeg4 video files. By using the Pocket DVD Wizard, (a shareware application) I am able to convert DVDs and play them on the TX.Built-in WiFi finally! I have been waiting for Palm to offer built-in WiFi for several years and my wish has finally been granted. Although download speeds can be slow and browsing websites on such a small screen isn't fun. The browser does work and it is nice to be able to get online. I have gotten used to checking my Yahoo and Gmail web-based email accounts. (More on using the VersaMail later.)Edit Microsoft Word, Excel and Powerpoint files. The DataViz Documents To Go Professional suite comes standard on the TX. This allows you to create and edit Word, Excel and Powerpoint files on the TX. I haven't run into any compatibility issues transferring Office files between the TX and my desktop. This is great value. (Alas, no spell check. If you want spell check, you need to upgrade to the Premium edition.)Leave your laptop at home. When I purchased my TX, Palm included a mail-in coupon for a free wireless keyboard. This is a great addition. I know Palm's Graffiti language, but when it comes to typing, a keyboard beats a stylus. The keyboard folds up into a small package and it fits into my coat along with the TX. Now when I visit an office, the library or a bookstore caf', I can just take it out and start typing. Unfortunately, I noticed that Palm discontinued the keyboard give-away shortly after I got mine, but I still recommend picking up a wireless keyboard because it makes the Palm so much more useable.Now for the features that I wish Palm had included and/or improved:The biggest omission is there is no built-in microphone. This is strange because microphones have been included in most high-end Palms and Handsprings for several years. It would have been great if Palm had included one because combined with the WiFi, this device would be perfect as a WiFi phone using Skype. I have friends using Skype with their Windows Pocket PC phones. It would also be nice to be able to dictate memos.A better email client. Now that the Palm TX has WiFi, an email client is a necessity. I have found that the current version of VersaMail that comes with most Palms, works OK with certain email services like Gmail and AOL, but I cannot get it to work with my hosting company's email. There is no way to set up email authentication that most hosting companies require. I understand that Snapper email, a shareware program, does a better job, but I haven't had a chance to try it out.Incomplete multimedia software bundle. The Pocket-Tunes program that comes with the TX is an improvement over the Real Player included with previous Palms, but it still lacks the ability to play many formats, including Windows Media. I am sure this is a licensing issue and fortunately, all my music files are MP3, which it handles well. The TX also does not come with a video player; fortunately, I was able to download the free, TCPMP (The Core Pocket Media Player).Overall, I think the TX is the best Palm yet. I have been using it for nearly four months without any problems. I know eventually, I will replace it with a Treo. But for now, with its larger screen and ability to edit Microsoft Office documents, I like the TX.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best Palm so far...", "unixReviewTime": 1140825600, "reviewTime": "02 25, 2006"}

Any Windoz users will be thrilled with it as well and probably have saved at least $200 over getting a Windoz PDA. You can't really compare the raw Specs of a Windoz PDA to a Palm PDA. The reason is the Palm OS is a much more efficient operating system, so the Palm PDA, will run slicker, be simpler, faster, have better graphics and be WAY more reliable and about $200 cheaper than the heavy overhead Windoz PDA OS.  It is kind of like looking at the size, performance and speed of Intrernet Explorer to Firefox.Okay, for those T3 and T5 users like myself, here is what the story is:1. The CPU is Slower than both the T3 and T5's CPU. The T|X has 312 mhz, while the T3 runs off of a 400 MHz and the T5 runs off of a 416 MHz processor.2. The T|X has 128 MGs of total RAM (100 active), while the T5 has 256 megs of RAM with 215 megs available.3. While the screen is excellent abnd spec wise the same as the T5 and T3, I couold swear that the T3 has a brighter and clearer screen. It does seem to be the same as the T5.4. The T|X has wi-fi built in. It is an extra $90 or $99 for Wi-fi for the T3 and T5. A definate plus for those who need Wifi.5. The T|X supports Bluetooth, unfortunately, it still have Bluetooth version 1.1, as both the T5 and the T3 do. Version 2.0 is taking over as the standard for Bluetooth, but it should have AT LEAST version 1.2. This limits the speed and distance that Bluetooth uses, when comparing it to 2.0 or 1.2.6. The uniut is rather cute.7. The USB to T|X cablesare different than any of the other Palm's. So if you have some existing USB connect cables, they will not work.8. The battery is still non-replacable and has slightly less power than the T5 and is a lot better than the underpowered battery that Palm threw into the T3. Because of the lower CPU speed and memory, the strain on the recharable battery is less and stays charged for longer than the T5 and a lot longer than the T3.9. Unlike the T3, but like the T5, there is a lack of a microphone to record voice notes, there are no visual OR vibration on the alarm like on the T3.10. I would summarize it as a less powerful PDA than the T5, but has wi-fi built in and the rest of it is like a twin to the T5. I am disappointed that it is LESS powerful than prior units.11. It is at a far superior price point to any Windoz PDA, not even close. I have now seen the price of the T|X dropping to even as low as $175.00.  At least $200-300 less than a Windoz PDA that is a decent PDA.What I am truly hoping for is that the new owners of Palm PDA, gets some creative licensees for Palm OS. I know I was thrilled to hear that LG, makers of one of the best cell phones, CD/DVD roms, appliances, monitors, etc is a Palm OS licensee.Since Palm Os is not owned by the destructive management team that took over Palm Inc after split, I think we should see some great stuff and an expansion of functionality of the Palm OS, which should kick the heck out of whatever Microsoft can do or would do. Control of market place rather than creativity and innovation is what I think Microsoft's motto should be.I am delighted that England seems to be the only nation (certainly not the U.S.), who is not allowing Microsoft to buy off the politicians or buy out its ocmpetition. They are hold Microsoft to its agreed anti-trust rules. That means, more IT jobs, better hardware and much better software, choices , innovation, competitive pricing for the entire IT market place.Monopolies are the destroyers of a free enterprise system.JonFor those who have used those two superior products, it is a REAL disappontment, I wish I looked at the specs first.The T|X has virtually no new technology that Palm has not released before. It is like they took some parts that were hanging around, put in WiFi, which one had to pay extra for, as well as put in a slower CPU and put in 1/2 the Memory of its prior T5.  Plus they did something to the grafetti language where there is a delay now when I", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Slower and less features than other Tungsten's", "unixReviewTime": 1139443200, "reviewTime": "02 9, 2006"}

Don't be fooled like I was, the two systems cannot both be used simultaneously. Because I needed to use outlook, I had to manually transcribe all of my contacts into outlook.  Then because I had my contacts organized into sub folders in outlook, they wouldn't sync! So I shelled out another $50 to Chapura, the software company that sells the sync software to palm, just to make it work like it should have in the first place.  There still are a number of glitches in the sync process such as all of my preferences for font size and screen orientation are lost with every sync which I find so annoying that I try not to sync it unless necessary.  The USB sync cable that charges the unit is a nice idea but it is so poorly designed that if you move the unit during a sync, it looses connection and has to be reset to start over.  For the amount of money I spent on this device, I am extremely disappointed. It looks to me like palm has a short timer attitude about their operating system and they just don't care to make it work, they seem to be more in the business of selling additional software than making the operating system user friendly.  On the positive side, which does little to offset the negative, the screen is bright and readable.  The memory isn't lost if the battery goes dead and the screen is easily changed from portrait to landscape view and the full screen is useable because the input portion can be hidden.

I have purchased a replacement about every two years since, mostly because my boss is willing to accept it on my expense report.I have loved them all, rarely getting the vary latest model.  I bought the T3 about 2 years ago.  It was a real improvement.  But recently it completely refused to sync with my desktop computer after about a month of being rather fussy.  I changed out the docking stand and it still did not work.  First of April 06, I went for the TX, rather than the T5.  I never used the voice recorder on the T3 so I thought I could do without it.  Other bells and whistles looked to me to be a better combination for my taste, on the TX.Unlike the physician user who said the battery life was too short, the TX seems to have much more battery than the T3.  I had an external battery pack for the T3 and it gave me about 3X before the low power warning.  The TX runs just as long with just its built in battery as the T3 did with the extra battery.  It can use ordinary AA batteries in an external pack, but not as slick as the external battery for the T3.I have been using it for only 3 weeks, and have had none of the glitches others have reported here.

Before that, I used Palm's Graffitti on my Newtons. My phone is a Treo 650. Without question, the T|X is superior to all the rest. Oh, and I use it in combination with a Macintosh, (syncing via BlueTooth, usually) but have used it with Windows XP as well.A hand-held device slim and light enough to fit into virtually any shirt or jacket without being obtrusive, able to communicate via BlueTooth, infrared and Wi-Fi, with a screen that can be rotated 90 degrees, large and crisp enough to permit even my 62-year old eyes to browse web sites and view MP4 video, and with the ability to accept at least 2 gigs of SD memory, this is the device to own unless you are seeking the kind of game capability that only a PlayStation Portable provides.Of course there are cons. I suppose the greatest is the lack of a built-in microphone. But even that has been hacked by a very clever company that offers both a headset with boom mike and a tiny plug-in mic. Competing with the lack of a mic is the fact that the battery is sealed in the case, so that you can't carry another, fully charged, battery as a spare. There are external rechargeables to deal with this, but they are one more thing to remember, or to lose. Another negative is the lack of a Flash player, which makes YouTube and similar sites unusable, unless you know something I am not aware of. Of course there is no camera, either, but it's happy to accept your camera's SD card for either viewing or emailing.These things said, here are some recommendations:If you are going to use it for email from a corporate or university server, spend the necessary bucks on SnapperMail. It's more versatile than the included Versamail. But if possible, consider the mobile view of GMail (Google's free email service.) Not only is it beautifully designed, it's free. I have my other accounts forwarded to GMail and both read and send from there using the browser.TCPMP is a simply astonishing and free media player, with additional audio controls to boost and adjust the sound above what the T|X's controls provided. I am no audiophile, but I have used the T|X with a variety of earphones, including the Sony and Bose noise-cancelling variety on long flights, and simply cannot complain about sound. The only minor complication is that the AAC decoder must be tracked down and installed separately. For reasons of copyright, apparently, it does not come bundled with TCPMP. But a bit of astute Googling should solve that problem.With TCPMP on the T|X and something like the free HandBrake on the Mac or equivalent free software under Windows, one is able to convert one's DVD to a 700 MB file, drop it onto a 1 GB SD card, and take along a movie. Of course the picture is small. In fact, it's far better for viewing a favorite movie than seeing a particular title for the first time. But I own an embarrassing number of media-playback devices, some with larger screens and/or greater capacities, and the size and weight of the T|X trump them all. So much so that I simply passed on the video iPod and will continue to until its screen is significantly larger or I can afford those video goggles that are now available.The latest version of Pocket Tunes is both a fine audio player and your link to Internet radio. Include it in your budget if MP3, playlists, podcasts and streaming audio are important. They are to me, so I wouldn't be without Pocket Tunes.VoIP via the T|X appears to be possible. With the external headset and some new software, others are reporting success. My router is not letting me do that from home, and I have yet to try it elsewhere, but don't be surprised if you hear that people are using their T|Xes as Wi-Fi phones.Finally, (well, there is no \"finally,\" but I have to stop somewhere) I own a Bluetooth keyboard so that I can use the T|X as a sort of substitute for my laptop. They work flawlessly together. Would I try to do a lot of detailed formatting and revision on that 4-inch screen? Of course not. But for sheer text entry, such as a first draft of a paper, it's just fine.So here is the final indicator of how well I like this device: If it were to break, or if I were to lose it, I would buy another.

I dropped my last Clie and the backlight quit working still works but too expensive to fix.  It was the bomb.  So I use and older model for the past year which suited me fine; so I thought.  I started having issues with that and decided to buy a new Palm.  I hessiatated for awhile to buy one.  I didn't like the fact Palm's didn't have a scroll wheel like Clies.I now have owned the Palm TX for a month now and I could never go back.  Most of my programs worked and I had to upgrade some others.I love the:1.  Widescreen it make reading spreedsheets much easier.  The included Documents To Go is much better than the Quickword I have been using for the past 6 yrs.  You can also see more video and pictures with the Widescreen.2.  The intergrated Palm Desktop.

Pocket Tunes, it comes with it and it is a great app.  I have used it for a couple of years now.  I recommend the upgrade it's only $30 but, money well spent.  With the upgrade you can play WMA's and OGG file.  Tailor the sound better with more eq options.4.  Isilo a reader app. is a pleasure to use and read in the wide screen format.5. Addit is a nice app that keeps you up to date on the latest news (Rueters)6.  WiFi.  I was skeptical at first but it works well considering your using a Palm.  It is much better the my Clie.

I have had a Palm Vx, m515, and now this one, and its capabilities blow the others away. The screen is fantastic. I love the extra space and resolution, plus the landscape mode. Having wifi is a huge plus even though I don't have a wireless network at home or work. With the better processor, this is also super fast. It sorts through 300 records in Smartlist in about a second.Still I had some disappointments:The screen isn't glass like the Vx. This probably makes it less likely to crack, but it makes the grafitti area more likely to be damaged and an overlay, at least in the grafitti area is a must. Even using a protector, I still had problems with grafitti skipping (like an \"o\" might become a \"c\" plus a blob even though I wrote an \"o\") and wound up returning the first one I got after about a month. If you don't bear down, it will skip. If you do bear down you are more likely to damage the screen. I have to take a star off for that.I use a lot of third-party programs and many of them simply don't work or will crash the TX. Generally I can find substitutes, but I still miss some of that and it was an ordeal at the beginning. I don't think \"hacks\" are allowed anymore at all. But anything still being developed works fine. Also I really miss the old grafitti. I couldn't get used to the new version which seemed incredibly slow and clumsy. Fortunately there is a way to get the old version back.I don't see why they couldn't make the silkscreen \"buttons\" customizable like the actual buttons are. In fact you should be able to change the icons. I don't use the Palm for e-mail and the media button is also kind of useless for me. I'd rather have the calculator and search buttons back.The browser has problems. Wikipedia just shows up as a vertical line of letters (there is workaround for this problem documented on Wikipedia, but it only works for that site). Also, if you don't crash while browsing, it isn't uncommon to crash shortly *after* browsing in a different program. Some secure websites simply won't work at all. I have to cut Palm some slack on that since handheld devices can't have browsers as good as a desktop, but being able to turn the screen to landscape should solve most things and it simply doesn't here. There is no excuse for the crashes.Despite the negatives, there were some nice surprises too:I love using the Palm as an MP3 player. Among MP3 players it is bulky, but since I'm carrying it anyway, it really takes no additional space. I use the included pTunes player and bought a 2 GB card with several hundred songs on it and I love it. I use the Palm more than my 20 GB iPod now.It also makes a great video player. Once I figured out the right mix of tools, I was able to put DVD's on another 2 GB card. I can put 8 episodes of my favorite TV shows on one of those cards and it looks great using the free full-screen TCPMP player. People are amazed with that feature. The screen is bigger and has more resolution than a 5G iPod.Battery life is surprisingly good. It's nothing like the Vx which lasted a week or more, but it is as good as the m515 even playing an occasional movie and using the mp3 player.The integration of everything could be better, but that's part of the deal with an open platform.

(mentioning one more time in case there is someone from PALM reading this thread)- It could have a program bundled with it to manage the folders..... And also, to become a Removable Drive (like the Lifedrive), it would be a good thing as well...Anyway.... Those are some points I think it might help everyone to decide.... But this is a very good PDA...Really pleased and it does the job !! a good one...Way to go Palm, but please present some improvements next time, then you will get a score of 10 \"with class honour\", for now.. It will pass with a score of 9 !!;-)", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Very Good PDA.... Good Deal...", "unixReviewTime": 1140652800, "reviewTime": "02 23, 2006"}

I briefly flirted with switching to a pocket PC, but decided to stick to machines running the Palm OS since that is what I am accustomed to and it is certainly adequate for most of my needs.I purchased my TX as a replacement for a Clie (which was itself a replacement for a Palm).  The Clie proved to be far superior to Palm PDAs of its day, but Sony is now out of the PDA market, which after a bit of shopping around led to my decision to return to Palm.  The TX is a reasonable replacement for the Clie in the sense that it includes all of the same functionality (and has some improvements: larger screen, vertical and horizontal view modes, longer battery life).  The only downside is that it is a bit bulkier.  I knew this when I purchased it and hoped that the added features would compensate, and I feel that they do.  If I only wanted the Clie functionality, the TX would be worth 5 stars; however, the added promise is wireless access and that isn't fully up to snuff.I use a secured wireless network with WEP key, and and am happy to report it is fully supported, so internet access is not a problem area.  As at least one other reviewer has noted, Palm's VersaMail is less than adequate.  My internet provider is Comcast, which is in the list VersaMail supposedly supports.  I can use it to receive email, but even though the VersaMail \"advanced\" configuration indicates authentication support is on, send mail doesn't work.  Comcast lays the blame squarely on Palm, and rightly so, which I think is enough for a one star deduction.  Of course, if you can access email through the web (which I can with Comcast), this is not a make or break issue.  The web browser could be better, but works OK, especially given the screen size.  I don't have a blue tooth enabled phone, so I can't say plus or minus regarding that feature, nor do I do text messaging.  I had Documents to Go on the Clie, and while it's nice to have it on the TX for occasional use, word processing is really something for full size computers. Ditto for music (get an Ipod).Palm's installation software is one of those that insists it knows best, which would probably have been OK on a system that had never had a PDA using Palm OS.  In my case, the setup program insisted on installing in my Clie directory, which resulted in Clie specific programs getting picked up by Sync, which crashed the setup and resulted in the TX being rendered unstable (couldn't sync and had errors on startup).  I got back in control by doing a hard reset on the TX (you have to go to Palm's TX site to get the user manual to find out how) and starting over, this time making sure the Clie installs were not picked up.If you are considering Palm's hardcase, you need to be aware that it has at least one annoying design flaw - you can't get to the stylus without flopping the TX away from the case.  I plan to peruse the after-market to see if anyone has one without this drawback.One final note: the USB cable has itty-bitty plastic alignment ends for plugging into the TX that I'm sure will break off in time.  I've also found that you have to push it in hard prior to sync to make sure the signal gets through.  Perhaps the optional cradle doesn't have this issue.8/14/2012 update: As an FYI, I pounded this thing for over 6 years before it finally called it quits.  Its only maintenance was when I replaced the battery a couple of years ago (a real feat of courage, since the battery is soldered in and not designed to be replaced).  After noodling around for a couple of weeks looking at what kind of device might best replace it, I finally decided none of them could and so just bought myself a new one (there are still some for sale at reasonable prices).  I've been using Blue Tooth via Palm Desktop ver 3.2.2 by ACCESS on Win 7 X64 for Hotsync (and as a result have nothing good to say about BT), but albeit quite slow it did do the job of restoring my data and configuration (hint, you have to turn off the USB Hotsync connection option on Palm Access or you will get a port already in use error when the T|X tries to connect via BT).  The long and short of it is the new T|X is now an absolute clone of the old one.  There are several reasons I decided to stay with this evidently dated Palm technology: 1) the calendar is far better than any I've tried on other devices (and besides it has my travel history on it for many years) 2) its alarm will actually awaken me 3) it crosses time zones easily 4) my contacts list is very easy to peruse and is loaded with useful information on each entry 5) it just isn't that hard to carry in my pocket with my cell phone (which has a lot of the same features, but just isn't as helpful), and anyway the other usual PDA knick knacks occasionally come in handy.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "should have been better", "unixReviewTime": 1139011200, "reviewTime": "02 4, 2006"}

Coach Wade\"", "helpful": [27, 31], "reviewText": "I've had this PDA for just over a year, obtaining it as an early birthday present in early April of 2006. In that time I have been nothing but inordinately frustrated with the defects inherent in this device.Defect number one: Video Problems. According to specs, the Palm T/X is supposed to offer video playback. As a football coach, I have literally hundreds of hours of video. I've compressed these files with two different video compression tools, and they play back fine on both of my computers. However, once dragged through the Palm conduit for installation onto the T/X, sound is out of synch and video is choppy. In short; it does not perform as it is supposed to and advertised to.Defect number two: Touch Screen Misalignment. The lower 1/4th inch of the screen does not align the pointer properly. This makes it impossible to write notes, or even to tap out messages using the keyboard, since no matter how carefully you place the stylus, the device records pressure slightly to the side. This makes note taking, document editing, and other routine PDA mechanics into an exercise in frustration. (Indeed, it defeats the purpose of even HAVING a palmtop computer.) Resetting the screen does nothing.Defect number three: Palm's lack of support. After contacting them within six weeks of purchase regarding these problems, Palm's \"answer\" was for me to shell out shipping to send the device in for repair/replacement with no guarantee that they would not turn about and try to foist the problem back onto me as \"misuse\" of some form. (Or the old standby, \"We can't find a problem, sorry.\")Defect number four: Macintosh compatibility. With the Microsoft blunder called \"Vista,\" more and more people are switching to different operating systems. The Mac version of the Palm desktop is barely compatible with the operating system, and some blunders are absolutely inexcusable: color codes do not transfer between iCal and the Palm device, for example. Notes sometimes do not transfer clearly and are either garbled or strung together as one long note. The only thing that somewhat compensates for these screwups is the use of \"The Missing Synch\" to offer cross compatibility. Why third party software should be needed to connect the leading palmtop operating system with the number two desktop computer operating system is beyond my understanding, but it's an extra thirty bucks Mac users need to shell out to get the darn thing to work.Defect number five: Network access. The T/X is billed as a laptop replacement, especially in the wireless computing area. With modern broadband connectivity everywhere, web developers are using more and more graphics and video, things that take time to download. The extremely S-L-O-W wireless network card in the Palm T/X means that it can take several minutes to even load a basic Amazon.com search page, or reference your email. It's both faster and more productive to tote the laptop instead, since the network interface is quicker and the typing generally moves faster than trying to get \"Grafitti 2\" to understand your handwriting.My wife received a Dell Axim as a gift, and the more I played with it to set it up (also requiring Missing Synch, unfortunately, but seeming to work much better with the built in Macintosh applications.), the more I began to like it. Unless I can find a decent cell phone/PDA, my next palmtop computer will be a Dell Axim. Or possibly a notepad and paper, which would still be more productive than the Palm T/X that I stopped using out of frustration several months ago. $299 down the drain.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "By far the worst PDA I have ever used.", "unixReviewTime": 1179878400, "reviewTime": "05 23, 2007"}

It is powerful, fast, has a generous amount of built in storage ( with a SD/ SDIO slot for more ), infrared, and has both Bluetooth and WiFi technologies.This is the 6th Palm device that I have owned and it is by far the best. Aside from performing it's basic PIM / HotSync tasks flawlessly with my iBook, the screen is large enough that I can actually read documents and play games without going blind. Although I own an iPod Video, the TX is much better for sharing photographs.I am also impressed by the quality and usefulness of the basic software package. You can easily surf the web check email ( even .Mac accounts! ) open a variety of documents, view photos, play mp3's, and watch film clips without needing any third party applications. I am particularly pleased by the ease of setup for using the Bluetooth and WiFi functions. The WiFi is completely intuitive, with extremely clear instructions. Whether connecting to your home wireless network or a T Mobile Hot Spot you're up and running in seconds. But what really amazes me was how simple it is to pair my TX with my Motorola V330. I have the T Mobile Unlimited Internet plan and have used my phone with my iBook to get online when I am on the road in places where there is no other internet access available. That combination has  functioned very , very well, but it involves numerous steps that must be followed EXACTLY. However, I found that the nice folks at Palm have already anticipated situations such as this and the setup for the TX is virtually automatic. I can honestly say that I was stunned by the simplicity of the process.I also purchased the Palm Universal Wireless Keyboard ( once again a snap to utilize ) and found that I could use it to write emails while connected to the internet either by Bluetooth or WiFi. In spite of my large, clumsy fingers, I find the keyboard to be highly easy to use. I also purchased the extended warranty, and, as I have found to be the case in the past, the tech support is absolutely first rate!Finally, I must concur with the other reviewers who have written about the occasional performance glitches. Frankly, I have never owned a Palm that didn't have it's little \" moments \",  but  Palm is Mac friendly and I think that the TX delivers so much for the money that I have no problem overlooking the rare hiccup.The TX is well designed, extremely versatile and reasonably priced.

With Bluetooth, you can make a hotsync without having to hook up the unit to your computer (provided your computer is bluetooth of course!); you can also exchange files with your computer or any other Bluetooth device, like a phone. With Wifi, you can surf on the web provided you have a wireless emitter nearby. The Palm comes with a free one-month subscription to the T-Mobile hotspot network.In addition, like all Palm, it is easy to use and the operating system is stable contrary to the Windows Mobile O/S, especially the latest one (2005 I believe). What I like with Palm is that it is easy to use, you don't waste time reading the user's guide for ages before being able to use the main functions.Now the drawbacks:1. The protective cover that comes with it is really cheap, very difficult to install, it ended up in the bin... A pity because the screen is good, fortunately I had a leather case.2. The battery is not replaceable, when it dies, your Palm dies with it. I guess it is not really a problem if the battery is not faulty: my last Palm (3C, a dinosaur now) started to show weakness signs after 5 years, which is OK I guess. After 6 years, my old Palm 3C does hold the charge for a very long time.3. Versamail is not compatible with Hotmail, which is to me the major drawback. I do not know why, if it is Microsoft or Palm at fault, but bottom line the only way to access my hotmail account from the Palm is through Internet and the Hotmail login window and it is not very practical; I guess the lay out is better with versamail.4. I struggled a bit to set-up the Bluetooth hotsync, you have to create a serial port (fictive), the explanations were not very complete, they said to check your computer's manual... I used the serial Port 7, it worked.Despite these drawbacks (which are minor to me, hence 4 stars), I am overall satisfied.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good value for money", "unixReviewTime": 1137283200, "reviewTime": "01 15, 2006"}

Bellin \"analog_j\"", "helpful": [47, 49], "reviewText": "First of all, I had been, as of late, only sporadically using a Zaurus ZR-5000, itself, a neat piece of useful and easy to use electonics.  With a huge, b/w screen you can write on, it had amazing capability for its time, including wi-fi capable -- and this was for an item from the early '90s!However, with its built-in mini-keyboard and large LCD screen, it is relatively large and cumbersome.  I used it primarily for contacts and sometimes for tasks and appointments, but it was really too large and heavy for me to carry around all the time (I don't carry a briefcase and rarely use a shoulder bag.).  Using it for appointments just really didn't make sense if I wasn't going to carry it around.  It had synching capabilities with a desktop, but it was slow and the built-in software was only marginally compatible with Microsoft's products.  My wife has a Psion and, while more up-to-date than the Zaurus, was still in that league.I had been eyeing Microsoft CE products and Palms, but I thought they were expensive for what they did, and I wasn't too thrilled with the Graffiti writing.But finally seeing how streamlined, fast and capable the new ones are, I wanted to investigate.  There are the Microsoft versions such as those put out by HP and Dell, but those are still pretty expensive.  Then there were the Palms that were either high-priced as well, or the less expensive ones which were pretty much good for appointments and contacts.  Not bad, and the new Z22 is a great value for something like that, but the Palm TX seemed, from other online reviews, seemed to be more reliable in terms of build quality than some in the recent past.  Moreover, I have read that the Microsoft-based products tended to crash alot (the computer software has an internal conflict and inadvertently shuts down.).I saw this unit on Amazon for $270 with a short-term offer of a free Palm wireless keyboard.  That sold me, and I knew Amazon offered a 30-day trial anyway.Having used it for about 6 weeks, I can tell you that it's brilliant for the money.  The built-in office programs seemlessly integrate with the real things (and I understand that the software used by Palm is better than Microsoft's own stripped down PDA versions.).  The internet browsing software works very, very well.  It's not as robust as the one on your computer, but you'll be surprised as to how good it is.  Blazer, the browsing software, is selective as to the sophistication of content it will download.  While it's as fast as broadband, for sure, it's faster than my dialup used to be.  There is also an option for text only downloads which is extremely fast.The screen is extremely bright and resolution is quite good.  I use a Sony CRT at home, so I'm used to great color and resolution, but this is quite good.  In sunlight, it's not great.This is not a substitute for a laptop, but for checking email on the go, or doing a quick Google, it's pretty amazing.  We were in a theater a few days ago, and we were trying to figure out the background of an actress.  There happened to be a wireless connection in the house, so I was able to quickly get on the internet and Google the actress and got our answer.As for the memory and processor, it's plenty for most lay-users, unless you're going to download LOTS and LOTS of games.  On the other hand, with the SD card slot, you could load LOTS and LOTS of games on a card or two or three.  The processing speed?  Palm has chosen well for this price range.  The TX cannot multi-task.  When you leave one thing, it will close down when you open up another.  This means the processor does less work.  Because of the uncanny methodology of the browser, the speed of going around the internet is usually good, and has been tested to be faster than the basic Dell model which has a faster processor.  The reason why the Dell seems slower is because the Microsoft operating system is more cumbersome.  It is capable of multi-tasking, but it's greater sophistication results in slower everyday tasks performed on the PDA.  The top of the line Dell is supposed to be terrific and potentially worth it for someone who is doing a lot of sophisticated stuff on their PDA, but it's almost twice the cost of the TX.For those who must have an even faster processer, the Palm Mobile Manager, retailing for $100 more than the TX, has a 33% faster processor and 4gigs of built-in memory (as opposed to the 128megs built-into the TX).For me, the TX is extremely impressive and I don't need the Mobile and I didn't want to spend more money.  Considering the deal I got (w/free keyboard), it was a no-brainer. I have also bought two games for it, Village Sim and Bejeweled 2, and the bright, rich screen is just the ticket for them.And by the way, the Palm wireless keyboard works flawlessly.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Brilliant Piece of Mid-Priced PDA Engineering", "unixReviewTime": 1145318400, "reviewTime": "04 18, 2006"}
