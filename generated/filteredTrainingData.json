For  those of you that may complain about the $10/month (or $200 one time)  charge for the programming data service, I would suggest that this is a  minor cost compared to what you are probably paying for cable or direct tv,  AND I would submit that the TiVo service will greatly enhance your ability  to utilize and manage the 50 to 250 channels that are available with cable  or satellite.Do I watch alot more TV than I did before?  Not really, but  now I always have something to watch that I'm interested in rather than  just watching what happens to be currently broadcasted.Did I consider  Replay?

I can honestly say it's changed the way I view television (however corny their ad slogan is).I set up my TiVo in late September, and I haven't looked back since.  The setup took an extraordinary amount of time (at least 2 hours), but once I got rolling, everything else was pretty easy.  I can't tell you how much I enjoy taking my time to do things instead of rushing home to catch my favorite program.  I don't have to worry, because TiVo's got me covered.Not only has the TiVo recorded programs I like to watch, but it recommends show that I might watch (though the use of the Thumbs Up-Thumbs Down recommendations I give to specific shows), and I can say that some of the recommendations they've given have hit the nail right on the head.  The recommendations can be a little weird though.  I mean, I'm a guy who likes The Simpsons, but does that mean I'll like Rugrats as well?This is not a perfect unit, though.  Drawbacks include missing recording cues (although not entirely TiVo's fault, but you'd think some networks would get on the ball here and standardize when they start and stop a show).  You wouldn't know how many times I've said &quot;Oh, the recording started late again,&quot; or &quot;Why did you cut off the ending?!?!?&quot; Also the unit, in a quiet room, can be a little noisy.  When I'm watching a show late at night, I can hear the unit's hard drive churning.  Maybe I'm nitpicking, but I thought you would like to know.Another drawback is the inability to totally skip over commercials.  You can fast forward, sure.  You have to be good at timing the fast forward right so that when you hit play, you'll catch the show just after commercial.Yes, the product has drawbacks, but I can look past that for now and say that this product is amazing.

Besides, it's not Tivo, but Philips that seems to have the quality problem (I'm not sure how the Sony versions rate on quality).But there are some steps you should take if you buy one:First, buy the extended warranty plan that most stores offer. You'll pay extra, but it will still be less then paying $100 for Philips to fix it. And store warranties last 3 years, unlike the awful 3 months labor, 1 year parts warranty that you get from Philips.Second, buy a special power strip that includes inputs for cable and telephone lines. This will stop any power surges from hitting your Tivo, which is what I suspect is causing a lot of these failures.

It's pretty much as great as everybody says.  I've had mine for a couple of months now and have no major complaints.  However, in case Tivo's reading, all my (minor) complaints  follow:Tivo comes with all kinds of hardware.  Everything except a coax  splitter which you need to buy if you want to continue using the tuner on  your TV.  (Which I think would be just about everybody because you have to  do this if you want to watch live TV while Tivo's recording).The Season  Pass records all showings of a particular show no matter when or what  channel it's on.  However if you pick a show that's in syndication or a  cable show that's repeated often, you'll get many more than you actually  want.  It'd be better if a Season Pass was only good for one channel and  time period.  Also be nice if it were smart enough to not record additional  showings of the same episode.  Another bad thing about this is that it will  not allow you to create other Seasons Passes if it thinks it interferes  with the first one.  (Like say you only want a Seinfeld season pass for a  4pm showing but Seinfeld also runs at 9pm on some other channel; I can't  set up a season pass for some other 9pm show without disrupting the first).  Of course the way around this is to record by time but I think some  improvements can be made.When watching live TV, it keeps the last 30  minutes UNLESS you switch channels or a new show starts.  This means that  if I stop watching (without pausing) near the end of a show and a new show  starts in the meantime, I'll have lost the ability to go back and watch the  end of the show I was watching.  I don't see why they blow away the last 30  minutes when a new show starts, particularly if it's on the same  channel.As other people mentioned, it'd have been nice to have a  skip-forward feature so you could skip forward in increments of 30 seconds  or something.It'd be nice to have a menu option to have a less  conspicuous play bar (or to put it at the top of the screen instead of the  bottom).  It covers up things like Who Wants to be a Millionaire questions  until it times out and disappears.Sometimes the sound loses its top  frequencies such that it sounds like a bad speaker.  S sounds sound like  static.  This might be a function of the broadcast but live TV doesn't  sound that way.It'd be great to have a VHS record list feature so you  could record multiple programs to videotape all in one go.  Sometimes I  make tapes for my  overseas friends and having to record one 1/2 hour  program at a time is a pain in the rear.When scrolling through program  listings, it makes you wait a second before bringing up the next screen.  It should be pre-loading each screen in advance so it doesn't have to waste  this kind of time.Due to program scheduling, many times it will miss the  last 30 seconds or so of a broadcast (so you might miss that last joke  while the credits are scrolling).  It should give you an option where it  will always record a couple of minutes before/after a program (if there  isn't another program scheduled to be recorded immediately afterwards).I  guess that's about it.

ReplayTV sells for about $200  more than TiVo, because the ReplayTV subscription charge is included in the  purchase price.  TiVo sells for about $200 less, but you must buy the  subscription.  The total cost is essentially the same.One advantage to  TiVo, that ReplayTV doesn't offer, is that you can also elect to subscribe  to TiVo by the month ($10) or year ($100) if you don't want to shell out up  front the $200 for the life-of-the-TiVo subscription.  ReplayTV  subscriptions are for machine life only.

Now I can't believe that I ever lived without it! I've only had it for a month, but now whenever I watch TV somewhere without TiVo, I get so frustrated because I can't pause, rewind, have an instant replay, etc. I can't imagine living without the TiVo-- I hardly ever use my VCR anymore.Setting up the TiVo is not as easy as they make it out to be -- if you have cable box you may have to spend countless hours fiddling around behind your TV before you can get the TiVo to work, because it's meant to work with either Direct TV or a Satellite. Nevertheless, it DOES work with almost ALL TVs and set-ups, and after you first get it all set up, it's effortless to use. The interactive menu is intuitive and easy-to-use, so you'll be setting up Season Passes to record your favorite shows as soon as you start. You can search for shows to record by Time, Channel, Name or Genre, and you can get a &quot;Season Pass&quot; in order to record the show whenever it's on.I love always having a selection of shows I like ready for me to watch, instead of having to channel surf endlessly to find something. Though there may not be a full 30 hours of recording time on the TiVo (30 hours is only with &quot;Basic&quot; sub-par Quality picture-- and Best Quality you can only record 9 hours), I still find that I always have extra room left over to record my favorite shows. I've actually found that I don't watch MORE TV now that I have the TiVo, I just watch TV shows that I actually like, at times when I am available. I get more homework done now (no joke). If there is extra room available, the TiVo actually records TV Shows that it &quot;thinks&quot; that you would like, since you are able to rate TV Shows and Movies, it can choose similar ones that you might enjoy. For example, if you give &quot;Friends&quot; 3 thumbs up, it may record &quot;Seinfeld&quot; for you if you have extra room. If you don't want the shows it it records, you can simply delete them or give them a &quot;Thumbs Down&quot; rating. The more shows you rate, the better TiVo understands your personal tastes. The only thing I wish it could do is record on one channel while I watch another, but it is understandable that it cannot. Also, TiVo comes up with &quot;updates&quot; now and again to improve on its features, so if something isn't perfect now, it may be improved in the future. For example, some reviewers complained that while recording sports, TiVo would fail to record if the game went into overtime, but now TiVo has a feature which lets you &quot;cushion&quot; your recordings by however much time you want, to ensure that you don't miss anything.One of the best features by far is a the &quot;Live TV Guide&quot; -- if you just press the &quot;Live TV Guide&quot; button while watching TV, a menu pops up on top of the screen giving the name of the show or movie, a brief plot summary, who the actors are, when it started, when it ends and what's on after it. Watching TV was never so easy. Whenever I show my friends how TiVo works, they are amazed by how we can pause, go get a drink or go to the bathroom, then come back and fast forward through all the commercials. You'll also never have to say &quot;Wait! What happened?? I missed it!&quot; because you can simply rewind backwards in the program and watch it again.I know that I am gushing about this, but TiVo seriosly has changed the way I watch TV-- as many other reviewers have said, TiVo lets YOU control your TV, not the other way around.

I, too, own a VCR.  And with all the good intentions in the world of taping programs that I wanted to see - I NEVER DID.2. Aren't you sick of missing your favorite TV shows?  With Tivo you will never miss your favorite shows again - in addition, my little Tivo friend may help you find new favorite shows.3. Don't you hate commercials as much as the next guy?  With Tivo, you will never be forced to sit through another minute of those crappy commercials.  You will not even know what people are talking about as they discuss the new Bud commercial...you'll merely shake your head and know that those poor, unfortunate souls don't have a Tivo at home.4.

After 30 mins of pause, it starts  playing again.

Stupid decision !I finally bought myself a Palm Vx this August and it has changed the way I use and access information on the move. It's forte is dependable connectivity and it does that so well. The Vx ships with Chapura PocketMirror, which an excellent sync/conduit manager, optimised for Outlook users (97-2000) and is a breeze to set up. PocketMirror integrates seamlessly with Palm's own desktop manager - just follow the instructions and you will be able to hotsync all your data in Outlook, literally within minutes. The Vx also ships with AvantGo, which is perfect for those of you who want to browse your favourite websites off-line and on the move (it syncs with your chosen sites every time you hot-sync; just a push of a button away).There is no point dwelling on the number of addresses, memos, etc. that the Vx can store, since these are pretty much the industry standard with other brands too and realistically, it is unlikely that you will ever run out of space for these items. The 8MB in the Vx comes in handy when you use applications such as AvantGo and if you tend to keeps hundreds of messages in your Outlook inbox (like I do!).I have recently added Documents to Go ([...] a 3rd party add-on.

I guess I would also like to have my 'Sent Items' mailbox from Outlook in my Palm - there probably is software available somewhere on the Net which does this, but I haven't found it as yet.Bottom-line.

They will help you organize you life in a way you would never had thought possible, and I am still thinking of new ways to use all the time. I just noticed something interesing about my Palm and thought I'd mention it here. A minute ago I put my Palm in its cradle to do a hot sync. I pushed the button but nothing happened. I tried it again but again nothing.Then I noticed there was a reminder notice on the screen. I cleared it by tapping the &quot;Okay&quot; button, and after that I was able to hot sync.Apparently the Palm OS considers a reminder notice to be at a lower interrupt level than a hot sync, which, if you think about it, is probably true, since you wouldn't want to miss a reminder notice because it got blown away by the hot sync screen.Just one more thing that shows how well-made and thought out these little gadgets are.One other thing. I also have a Compaq iPAQ, which I also have become very attached to, in addition to my Palm. Although the iPAQ hot sync process is a little easier than the Palm (you just put it in the cradle and the unit is automatically detected, you don't have to hit a button as with the Palm), the Palm does have one advantage here. I can hot sync when I'm dialed in and on-line with the modem in use. The iPAQ uses a USB port, which looks for a free COM port to work with, and this conflicts with the modem. When I try to hot sync while using the modem, I get a message that there is a conflict and it won't hot sync. This is despite the fact that my system has two COM ports and the Microsoft Windows diagnostics shows the second COM port as free and not in use.However, one interesting thing the iPAQ does is you can work with it while it is hot synching.

I was running short on memory, so that left the Palm IIIc, Vx and Jornada 540 for consideration.I tried the IIIc for a month. Found the color screen a  pleasure to work with. There are not that many 3rd party apps in color yet,  but that appears to be changing fast. I liked the TinySheet Excel  compatible spreadsheet in color. The black on white screen is very readable  for e-books. Battery life was acceptable. On a 3 week business trip I had  to recharge it only once. The downside for me is size, the comfort factor.  You can NOT comfortably carry a Palm in a shirt pocket. I carry it in my  pants pocket, with the V I would forget I had it until I needed it. The  IIIc, it was just always 'there'. The only other gripe I have is that it's  almost impossible to read the screen outside. Something I took for granted  on the monochrome V. Bright daylight however fully washes out color  screens.  I REALLY like the small updates to the new PalmOS. Eg. the  little shortcut bar that appears at the bottom of the screen for menu  shortcuts is an excellent innovation. It makes cutting and pasting as fast  as with the PC using the keyboard.I used the Jornada for 2 weeks before  I returned it. As my expectations weren't that high from my previous  exposure to the platform I can't say that I was dissappointed. However, I  still don't think MS is up to par. On the balance still more 'clicks' are  needed than on a Palm. I couldn't find those easy to use 3rd party freeware  apps such as the NY crossstreet finder, on PocketPC. On face value I liked  Excel, but I found it's small differences with the PC version annoying.  Knowing one, I made assumption about the other that didn't always pan out.  The high resolution of the screen is nice. For e-books the Jornada would be  good, if not for the poor passive matrix screen. For example, on the plane,  I could put the IIIc on the tray in front of me, and read at an angle. This  is impossible with the Jornada screen. For basic PDA functions it is  adequate. I feel the apps still are a bit sluggish. Playing MP3's is fun,  but with 2 songs at CD quality, memory is depleted which makes it  impracticle for multimedia, unless you spend more to expand memory. Forget  playing MP3's in the background while doing other work, the device slows  down to a crawl. Size wise, the Jornada is a bit bigger and heavier than  the IIIc, which to me is a problem as I already explained. Battery life  seemed shorter than the IIIc, though it may be subjective because it was on  a lot, while learning the PocketPC platform.The Palm Vx is basically a  faster Palm V with more memory. Just got it yesterday and I already love  it. This is the one I'm keeping. I suppose that after getting used to the  size and weight of the Palm V, there is no going back. However, I'm glad  that I went through the hassles of trying out the other 2 models. I learned  a few things:1) Size matters.2) Until technology for multimedia  matures, color screens do not add significant value to justify their impact  on size and battery life.3) PocketPC looked good on face value, but  didn't go the distance, however, I do believe that as technology advances,  multimedia such as MP3 playback will be great to have. I hope that by that  time Palm will have the capability.4) 3rd party apps add tremendous  value.

Broderick \"mikebinok\"", "helpful": [35, 39], "reviewText": "When my Palm V was stolen last May, I went right out and bought a Palm Vx to replace it!  Upfront, I should address the comment of the reviewer below who complained of losing his data when the device crashed.  The Palm Vx comes with software that allows you to create a copy of all your Palm data on your computer.  If you lose the Palm data for some reason (or the computer data), you can restore the lost data with a couple of mouse clicks. The Palm comes with a &quot;cradle&quot; that is used for recharging and for linking to the computer.  When my Palm was stolen, I easily restored my information into my new Palm Vx.  The process of storing data takes about 15 seconds, and literally just takes a button push after you have put your Palm in the cradle. I should mention that in 18 months of extensive use, I've never &quot;lost&quot; my data due to software failure.  I did lose it when my Palm was stolen of course, but was  easily able to replace it. I find two main uses for my Palm--As a scheduler, I can enter something I want to be reminded of at a future date, and have the Palm alert me at a specified time (typically five minutes before the meeting starts, for meetings at my work).  You can easily view all the items in place for each day, and there is also a weekly view.  This can be done years in advance, and doesn't have to be for work stuff--I have a gasket in an underwater camera which needs to be replaced in May, 2002, and I have entered a reminder to alert me at that time! The other thing I use it for is as a way to find &quot;forgotten&quot; information.  I make and store memos of important conversation or important information.  Also, I make notes in the &quot;address book&quot; of key information about people--Things I've discussed with them, or areas of expertise they have.  I can use the &quot;find&quot; feature on my Palm to locate a term.  So if I want to know what conversations I've had about widgets, or who I have talked to that knows about widgets, I can enter &quot;widget&quot; in the find feature, and I will be shown a list of all my memos that mention widgets in the text, and anyone in my address book who I listed as being widget-related!  Incidentally, I'll also get a list of any appointments in my calendar that mention widgets. If you are a busy person (and not just a business type, students, or homemakers may benefit as well) I believe you will be able to make good use of a Palm Vx.  You may be equally satisfied with a Handspring, or with other makes of Palm, though.  The two great advantages I see with the Palm Vx (or Palm V, if you can still find one) are that the profile of the device is very slender--It fits in my front slacks pocket without leaving a substantial bulge.  Second advantage is that the internal battery provides power for a week to two weeks of use, and can be recharged by resting in the cradle. No need to buy replacement batteries, or juggle them around replacing them.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I love mine....", "unixReviewTime": 976752000, "reviewTime": "12 14, 2000"}

Despite the hype over much higher priced units, I still think it's one of the best PDAs out there.What I Like 1. Memory, and lots of it. If 8 Mb does not sound like a lot, think of what you're using a PDA for. There's plenty of room for the phone book and appointment book. That's 80% of what I use my Palm for. I've never run out memory. 2. Lots of freeware and cheap shareware add-ons. The most useful is the new Palm PDF Reader from Adobe. I can take important documents with me as a PDF and have them as a look up document. Other nifty utilities I've picked up include a travel alarm clock with World Time Zones, IP Calculator and some neat games to pass the time. Coming on strong are text document readers and databases. 3. Good monochrome display with adjustable contrast. Sure color on PDAs is a hot topic, but from what I've seen, color is not worth it on a PDA. The color is poor and it really decreases battery life. 4. Built in rechargabe power and long battery life. No hassle with batteries: drop it in the cradle and it recharges. I've gone as long as three weeks without recharging.What I Don't Like 1. I had to add PocketMirror to synch with Outlook. When I upgraded my desktop, the Outlook synch was lost until I purchased a new PocketMirror. I have no gripe with the performance, I just wish this was a standard feature 2. No expansion capability. I know I said it has enough memory, but I wish I could add an MP-3 player or use SmartMedia for archive storage. 3.

I began my whole Palm expedition several years ago with a Palm Professional (yes, back in the day).  That worked out just fine for the time, but being a gadget junkie, I had to get the Palm V when it came out.  And can I say how much better it was?!?  Not only did you not have to deal with batteries, but you didn't have the bulk that the Palm Pro had.  A few other cool things - the cradle that has a place for your stylus.  This may not seem like a big thing until you leave you stylus on your desk and go home and realize that you need it. And I never had any problems with the software. So, as it was I was completely happy with my little, stylish Palm V.Then Handspring came out.  And I had to have that - for the MP3 player.  So I got rid of the Palm and got on the waiting list for a little iMac colored Handspring.  I was super excited - more memory and the cool Springboard feature seemed like it would be nice.  What a disappointment I was in for after having owned the Palm V.  First of all, my stupid Handspring crashed all the time.  Second, it ate batteries like a hog - where the Palm V didn't need batteries because it has the recharable Lithium Ion battery.  Third, it is the same bulkiness as the Palm Pro.  Fourth, there was no place for the stylus. And last, but definetely not least, the springboard module's turned out to be a joke - the release dates on them kept slipping.  I guess part of my problem is being an early adopter - but I sure did miss my Palm.So I gave in and did what any gadget junkie would do.  I sold the Handspring and upgraded to a Palm Vx.

The date book  instantly makes obsolete all those little paper-based 'pocket organizers'.  And the note pad and to-do list are just the thing for jotting this or  that.  Synchronization with a USB Mac is seamless and the Mac software,  based on Claris Organizer, is quite good.  (Be sure and buy the 3Com Palm  USB kit; other 3rd party USB-to-serial adapters I tried didn't work.)But  where the Palm really shines is in the 3rd party software, much of which is  free, that is available over the web.  Epocrates for doctors (a hypertext  drug guide a la the famous Pocket Pharmacopoeia) will become your portable  brain for drug selection and dosing.  And AvantGo, a service that allows  daily downloading of nearly any text-based web site into your Palm, is  highly useful; I use it for news (general and medical), sports scores,  current movie showtimes in my area, 5-day weather forecasts, and a daily  joke.  It eases the pain of spending 36 hours straight in the hospital.  Vindigo, a free city guide to restaurants and nightlife, is great but takes  too long to sync every day (adds about 5 minutes to a normally 2 minute  sync) so I took it off.There are also freeware amusements (Mulg,  DopeWars, and C.A. Explorer are currently installed on mine) and electronic  books (Victor, Adams, and Ropper's pocket neurology text, for instance)  that may be of use to you.  8 MB is plenty for all of the above - I have 4  MB to spare.The batteries recharge overnight in the cradle and last a  long, long time.  I would offer 2 caveats: 1,  Mac Outlook Express won't  interface with the nice e-mail app (Eudora does, though, if you want to  switch.) 2,  You can't just carry the Palm around in your pocket.  It'll  fall out onto the floor and the screen will crack.  Get either the Deluxe  Carrying Case or the Leather Belt Case.

What I've found that is most disturbing about those palmtops is  that they have so much more than you need, are larger, have reduced battery  lifes and are about twice as expensive as the wonderous piece of equipment  I am reviewing now.The Palm Vx is the latest and, in my opinion, the  greatest Palm of all the ones that 3Com have produced.  Using the latest  version of the palm OS, this device comes loaded with 8 megs of ram, a  battery that will last up to a month on one charge, enough programs to  organize your entire life, and an easy to learn writing technique called  graffiti.  And although it may not be quite as accurate as on the more  expensive PDA's, it does the job, and there is also a built in keypad that  can be used to input information.Syncronization with your computer or  laptop is simple too.  Just place the palm in it's handy-dandy charging  station (which is included) and hit the HotSync button.  All of your days  notes, scheduals, information, and whatever is easily backed up to your  hard drive.  And anything that you add to the computer transfer program  will be uploaded to the palm Vx.  In short, the setup is easy, the programs  are user friendly, and did I mention it only weighs 4 oz!  Also, unlike  it's palm bretheren (mainly the Palm III's), which have a hokey plastic  casing, this palm has a very sleak magnesium casing that is both stylish  and that just feels damn good in your hand.However, it does have it's  downsides.  For starters, the built in IR (infrared port) is almost useless  beyond 4 inches away which means that the transfer function between two  palms, although nice, isn't very useful in most real world situations.  Hell you can't even beam a signal across and empty room.  Second, unlike  it's cousin, The Visor, which was produced by the company who had the  original idea for the Palm, it has no extra memory slot and therefore  cannot have extra memory added to it.  However, since there is not much  that would use all 8 megs on the Palm Vx, you wouldn't need to expand your  memory anyway.  And thirdly, expect to buy a real case for the Palm  immediatly after your initial purchase since all the palm comes with is a  cardboard cover in leather that is attached to a stylus pen and that fits  in one of the two pen slots on the palm.In general, I find that the  palm Vx surpasses it's more expensive competitors in every way; from price  to simplicity, from form to function.  And if you need to get your life in  order without dropping a boatload of money on a color screen and useless  extras, then this is your best bet.  And to put it simply, I wouldn't trade  my Palm for any &quot;palm&quot;top PDA if you paid me.If you're still  curious about the more complex PDA's, go check out my review for the  Cassiopia E-115.

The Palm Vx was  only 6oz with battery and slim Palm case.  The Palm was also about half as  thick and an inch shorter with the same screen size although an inch in  taken up with the writing area. I first bought the Nino because as a  longtime PC user, I thought that WinCE would be more versatile. I thought  Microsoft would win the battle of the platform, thoughts of Apple thorough  my mind. I didn't want to find that I ran out of memory before it could do  everything that I needed it to do. I found the Nino a palmtop computer  trying to be an organizer and the Palm an organizer trying to be a palmtop  computer. The Nino could do everything and was very expandable. It is a  hand-held computer, but it was just too darn big to carry around in my  pocket. I don't carry a briefcase or travel for business. I wanted an  everyday organizer to hold contacts, itineraries, notes, lists,  appointments, financial information, simple maps and do some calculations.  The Palm Vx does all this in such a small size. If I needed to use a  computer on the road, I'd buy a laptop. I don't need to edit Word  documents, do any database work, access the Internet, use multimedia or  color, read books or play elaborate games on it. I just wanted something to  hold basic information and do relatively simple calculations till I could  transfer it back to my computer.

About 2.1 MB out  of 8 for the Palm vs. 15 MB out of 24 for the Nino (with CF card); the  programs use less memory. It my case, size mattered. I found I was never  carrying the Nino when I needed it. I'd leave it in my car. Overall, the  Palm does everything I need and want it to do. I do worry about  expandability, but so far it hasn't been an issue. If I had gone with the  Palm V I'd be in trouble. If you want something that could do those other  things, I'd just spend the money for a laptop.

You might have  done some research and know a little about what you're getting into, (which  I highly recommend) but it still seems like a $300 replacement for a  Rolexdex plus desktop calendar (which is exactly what it is).  I was turned  off by some other reviews because of the sheer detail that some experienced  users go to.  People literally come to depend on this things so much that  when new features come along they go insane =)  If you are like I was, you  simply want to know if this little thing is worth the money.The basic  function of any PDA is to organize your life, period.  You will get more  use out of the basic calendar, address book, To Do List, and Expense List  than anything else.  PDAs syncronize themselves with your computer at work  and at home.  Most people don't realize how nice this is until they use it.  Now that I understand it, I do it with everything.  I download my bank  statements from the Internet into Quicken, and then into my Palm.  If I  mark a purchase on my Palm, it automatically updates in Quicken when I get  home.  At work I track everything with Excel spreadsheets, and now I can  carry my entire job at my fingertips, in my Palm.  At home, I used to keep  email addresses only on my computer, and phone numbers on a Roldex in the  other room.  Now the information is everywhere at once, and the clutter of  these extra things is gone.  Should my palm ever get lost or stolen, I've  got a hassle-free backup on my PC at work and at home.  It has freed my  life by making organization easy and intelligent.I got the Palm IIIxe  because it has everything essential, yet is cheap enough that if I found I  never used it I wouldn't feel bad about the money I wasted.

They also play MP3  music, but with the money I saved I bought a dedicated MP3 player which is  much, much better than a PocketPC could hope to be.

The other Amazon reviewers can talk about how wonderful it is to own a palm pilot.The first palm I purchased had something seriously wrong with it.  I was getting numerous error messages and system failures that required that I repeatedly reset my palm, losing my data and everything.  Ugh.  I called Palm and they walked me through a thorough series of tests to try and fix it.  My call was handled quickly and efficiently, but with patience and concern on the part of the service representative.

When I upgraded my computer and tried to install the cradle and the hotsync program, the computer did not even booth, it just went dead.  After 25 minutes of a long distance phone call to Palm support service (no toll free number), they told me the problem was the port, so they could not solve it - the port was working. I wrote an e-mail explaining the problem, the answer two days later was I did not give enough information as I did not tell what hotsync program I installed in my computer - NONE!!!, they clearly did not even bother to read the nature of the problem.  They saw a missing field and they just assumed they could not help. Eventually, after the level of complaints Palm received on the issue was large enough, they informed via the website that some cradles are defective and they need to be replaced; however, the part cannot be ordered via web or e-mail, support had to be called.  Another 40 minute long distance call, and I was informed that in 48 hours the cradle adaptor will be in my house.  After 10 days without adaptor, I sent an e-mail to support asking for it, giving it the service order number.  The answer was to call parts, an 800 number, only 15 minutes of my time were wasted before I was informed I needed to call support, as parts had nothing to do with it.  Another 20 minutes of long distance to order again the part, as the service representative made a mistake in the previous order, so it could not be processed.  When I asked for the order number they informed me that their database is down and they are just filling orders by hand and they could not give me a confirmation number.

Looked closely at the Palm m110 and Handspring Visor, units which offered attractive prices, but with 2 MB RAM, felt they didn't have enough memory. Also considered the Handspring Visor Deluxe, but on the two models that I had a chance to try out, the screens weren't the same quality as those of the Palm IIIxe, and nobody could explain it.You may also wish to consider the new Palm m105. See the notes at the bottom of this review for more details.To be fair, I also considered some of the newer Windows CE devices, but was put off completely by the hand recognition software. It was too slow and hard to use, so that idea was dropped quickly. Used to use a Windows CE device made by Casio, which I put aside awhile ago. Had initially been encouraged to purchase a Palm device by one of my co-workers, but I felt that the Windows CE 1.0 device with its tiny keyboard was the way to go. Then I found out that it ate batteries at a very high rate. Lived with this for awhile, but the business of hardware ROM replacement to upgrade the unit was disturbing.The Palm does everything I need it to, and in the month that I've had it, I've been pleasantly surprised by its versatility. The quality has proven to be excellent. The case of the IIIxe, though an older Palm design, fits the hand quite comfortably.The Palm IIIxe comes with 8MB of memory. In useful terms, this means that you can store approximately 12,000 addresses, 5-10 years of appointments (that's about 3000 appointments), 6000 to do items, 3000 memos, 800 e-mails and many applications. The available memory has been ample to download and store a wide range of applications along with the room to store related data. The IIIxe (along with some other models) has 2 MB flash memory, enough to handle the upgraded (v3.5) OS and the built-in applications. I also went to the Palm Web site and downloaded the latest (v.3.5.2) OS and installed it. There were absolutely no problems like I had heard about with other &quot;Palm-compatible&quot; devices.The screen is sharp, clear and easy to read, indoors or outside. Though I might have preferred a bit stronger backlight for those times where there isn't much light, have learned to adapt to it quickly.The Graffiti handwriting recognition is forgiving and easy to master quickly. One of the reasons I went to a Windows CE keyboard unit a few years ago was fear of having to learn yet another way of inputting data. I couldn't have been more wrong - it's easy and quite intuitive. What's even more important is that I'm now taking notes in meeting with the device that used to be done on paper.The battery life is outstanding. It should last thirty days or more under regular use. Since one of my complaints with the Windows CE units was short battery life, I'm impressed.The built-in infrared port allows you to transfer documentation directly from any other infrared enabled Palm device. This function works quite well. I've transferred memos to and from a Handspring Visor Deluxe and other Palm devices.There are many software applications available for the Palm PDAs, including a lot of shareware and freeware. The commercial programs that are available are top rate, and you can even find applications that will let you edit Word and Excel files. You can even connect to Oracle 8I databases with currently available software.The Palm IIIxe manuals are excellent, and do a thorough job of documentation. You may find, though, that this device is easy to learn with little reading. Its interface is very intuitive, and that's helpful if you dislike going through manuals.This PDA syncs well with Microsoft Outlook, which is extremely useful for corporate users. This is a straightforward operation in which you place the Palm IIIxe into the supplied HotSynch cradle and push the button on the base. The HotSynch operation creates a log of what was done, so you can confirm that everything was updated correctly.Picky point - comes with a mediocre lightweight plastic stylus. Order an upgrade (or the Palm 3-pack) immediately. You won't regret it.You might also want to consider the new Palm m105. Though it has a smaller screen than the Palm IIIxe, it has many of the same features but is packed in the same case as the popular m100.If you are looking for a reasonably priced PDA that can live up to its reputation, then this is a first-rate choice.

I've found the Palm OS easy to use, very efficient, and well supported by third party developers, as well as by Palm.  The number of utilities available for the Palm OS really adds value to the product - particularly the web-enhanced synching utilities offered by everyone from Excite to AvantGo.  Using this free service lets you synch with any web page you select, so you always have the most current information available.  For example, I bookmarked the movie review page of an online newspaper in Toronto, and always had the most current reviews, times and locations of movies in Toronto, even though the online service wasn't specifically designed to operate with the Palm system.  Basically, any web page can reside on your Palm just by selecting it using this software.  I provide this as an example of the benefits of owning the industry standard OS rather than the less supported Windows CE. Now that I've mentioned why the Palm operating system is your best choice, I'll focus on the different Palm products available. Having used both the Palm IIIc, the Palm III, and the Palm Vx, I've got to say that the IIIxe really seems to hit the ideal price/feature point.  With all the memory of the more expensive models, and all the benefits of built-in synching to Microsoft Outlook and other software, it's a great little machine.  It also has an infrared port built in, which I was able to use to keep my home computer and my laptop at work (it has an IR port, too) synched with each other.  By the way, the IR port is also great for beaming your electronic business card to another Palm owner, or playing Battleship against another owner head-to-head. You can even set it up to let you write email messages, which will be stored in the Palm, and sent automatically when you next synch with your computer.  I mention this because it highlights the ability to personalize your Palm to do what you need it to do.  You can easily use it as a standalone device, or it can be as connected as you need it to be. There are three concerns you should be aware of when choosing this model over Palm's other offerings.  First, this model has a greyscale screen, not a colour one like the IIIc.  If you really want colour, this model isn't your best choice.  (You can read my review on the IIIc for more information on that product.)  Second, it has a plastic case which is thicker and less attractive than the brushed aluminum case of the V series of Palm organizers, which may be a concern for the more stylish among us.  Third, this one isn't rechargeable - it takes AAA batteries.  This might not sound like much of a concern, but there's something to be said for being able to drop the device into its cradle for a few minutes to recharge, rather than trying to limit your use of the organizer to conserve battery power.  One of my friends had a non-rechargeable model for years and purchased a new one with the rechargeable function.  He said he ended up using the organizer nearly twice as much as his old one, so this is probably something you should consider in your purchasing decision.  Notwithstanding these limitations, this is a great product with a great operating system, lots of features and third-party support, and is easy to learn and use.

The Palm IIIxe has over a month of battery life (compared to several hours with Windows CE), never crashes, and is so easy to use.  It syncs really well with Outlook 2000 and Outlook 98.  No problems  whatsoever.  I especially like the wide range of programs you can get  online for free or at a small cost.  Windows CE could not do that.  Now to  the Palm IIIxe itself.  I think this is the &quot;best value for the  buck&quot; Palm there is right now.  Sure, there is the Palm IIIc and the  Palm Vx, but they cost [more than this unit].  All three have 8MB of  RAM and the updated operating system.  The IIIc has the color screen, but  why do you need a color screen in a handheld?  If it is for playing games  in color, then you are wasting your money.  The Palm Vx is exactly the same  as the IIIxe, except it has the new style, but let me ask you this.  Why do  you need style in an organizer?  You may say that these two models have  rechargeable batteries, a feature that the Palm IIIxe does not have, but I  have been using Nickel Metal Hydrate batteries (NiMH) on my Palm IIIxe and  the work very well.  Get some more information from Palm users about their  experience with NiMH batteries....  After you answer those two  questions, you will agree with me that the Palm IIIxe is the best value  Palm out now.  I chose the IIIxe over the Handspring Visor Deluxe for  several reasons.  First of all, in the Visor Deluxe, you cannot upgrade the  operating system when new updates are introduced.  Handspring, however,  says that you can add in a Springboard module to upgrade the OS.  But how  will the device operate later if you switch the Springboard with another  one?  No more OS upgrade, that's what.  The IIIxe has flash memory so you  actually upgrade its operating system.  Second, I have read several user  comments on the Visor Deluxe.  Several people are saying that the Visor  screen breaks much more easily than the Palm IIIxe's screen because of its  flimsy case design.  Palm put the normal sturdy case found in the III line  on it's IIIxe.  Second, tons of customers have complained about  Handspring's customer support.  I remember one person said, &quot;There is  none!&quot;  I am very satisfied, however, with Palm's customer service,  especially their online customer service.  Take a look for yourself at the  Service and Support section at the Palm website.  So what do I use my Palm  IIIxe for?  I use it at school to keep me organized.  I am a very busy  person, but the datebook helps keep me on track with my appointments.  Also, I store my assignments on my Palm using a program called Four.Zero.

If you use a Canon digital SLR and are satisfied with the kit lens (18-55) then buying this lens can be the perfect next step for you. Practically speaking, you will be able to increase your zoom reach to the point where you can A) photograph birds in moderately distant trees, B) be able to zoom in on the other side of a valley and frame something of your interest. Those are just two examples. One thing you will NOT be able to do effectively with this lens, however, is to take sport shots with it. How so? Consider some of the following weakness:*At 300mm zoom range the highest aperture is limited to 5.6 (You will have to use very slow shutter speed to snap fast action shots; remember the inverse relation between aperture and shutter speed.)*The lens size/weight combination makes it hard to hold steady when attached to a camera like the Rebel XT*Slow and often inaccurate auto focus (I just don't understand why Canon makes a USM version of this lens for $20 more, but never includes it in the triple rebate program)*Chromatic aberration is significant in high contrast lighting like in full sun (if you do not know what Chromatic aberration means search the term online or check out my review of the Canon 28mm 2.8 on Amazon, but to summarize, it would be a discoloration at the fringes of objects in your picture)Those kinds of weakness will limit your ability to use this lens in all sorts of other situations/circumstances. As a practical rule to follow, if the lighting is less than ideal this lens will give you a hard time. Meaning, it will be possible to use it, but you may get too many blurry images because of shake from slow shutter speeds. As for what are ideal lighting conditions? That would be full sun with few or no clouds and with the light bathing your subject/object from the front or the side.So is this lens that bad? Not really, as with many other lenses, when the lens is coupled with a good camera it still out performs most Point and Shoot cameras. Plus it provides results at par or slightly below the kit lens (18-55). So if you are satisfied with your kit lens, which provides you with a zoom range comparable to 3X zoom (55/18= 3), why not add another lens that will expand your zoom range by another 4X (300/75=4)? Nothing wrong with expanding your horizon!PS. TWO MORE POINTS ABOUT USING THIS LENS: First, if you're confident you can handhold this lens at slow shutter speeds (I know I can't) then the low maximum aperture shouldn't be a major problem. Second, if you're fine shooting at high ISO (more like 400 or 800) then again the low maximum aperture shouldn't be a problem. The nice thing about photography is that you can do one thing in so many ways, so don't be afraid to explore with this lens!", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Is this lens as bad as some people say it is?", "unixReviewTime": 1144454400, "reviewTime": "04 8, 2006"}

I had to apply unsharp mask filter in photoshop several times to get something that I could put on the web.IMHO, Canon really failed on this one and I guess it's time they replaced this lens with something better.For those of you that are reading this review and are looking to purchase a lens in this focal length range (and price range!), I strongly suggest the Sigma. If possible, get one with the APO designation on it.  I guess it costs $50 more.  But the quality of images it produces is far better than this Canon. As a nice add-on it also offers a macro switch that enables close focusing to achieve a 1:2 magnification.I know there are brand afficionados out there that will buy nothing other than a Canon - good or bad.  If you are looking for quality in a lens of this focal length and price range, avoid this lens.  Also don't go to eBay and buy the IS version of this lens - it's got the same bad optics.  Canon recently replaced it with a 70-300mm IS.  I guess that is very good.  Of course, the legendary 100-400mm IS with a price tag of $1400 is stunning.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Canon failed in this one!", "unixReviewTime": 1129939200, "reviewTime": "10 22, 2005"}

Since owning it for two years - it seems to go further and further to the back of my equipment bag - and not taken in my backpack at all unless the climate is too harsh for my more expensive lenses.In fairness to the product - it is very GOOD for what it cost and how it is designed. It makes no pretension to be anything other than an AF f5.6 >75-300mm&lt; telephoto. The construction has remained solid - the zoom (fairly stiff or tight when new)sometimes makes funny noises from grit lodged in the 'nether regions' of the lens barrel (I am a defense contractor who travels to some pretty rotten climates).

Plan to spend much time in Photoshop to save your pictures2. Length of lens made it unusable with the dRebel pop-up flash (lens shadow). Immediate purchase of a 420EX Speedlight ($177+ see my review) cured this problem3. Front focus rotating lens element limited my filter choices to UV (haze) filter only4. Annoyingly SLOW auto focus5. Tripod is almost manditory with lower shutter speeds (see f4- 5.6 limits). The 1.6x magnification factor when seated to the dRebel brings the focal length out to over 450mm making off tripod use risky* Use of a BGE-1 battery grip ($100+ see my review) with this lens - lowers camera center of gravity-extra counter-weight makes lens use less stressful.Good price - fair optics - limited overall performance.

For example, in auto mode you can't use the flash redeye reduction, you must be in manual mode for that. The auto color balance is often fooled by dense clouds. You need to use the manual exposure adjustment in backlight or bright light conditions such as with snow in the background. The dynamic range seems not quite as good as the Kodak DC260.

Switching between viewing and capturing modes is simple and straightforward, and even the more advanced features (such as changing the flash mode) are easy to figure out even without reading the manual.Finally, the &quot;built in&quot; lense cap is a big plus. I didn't realize how nice this &quot;feature&quot; is until I briefly used a friend's digital camera and had to remove and replace the lense cap WITH EVERY SHOT. The built in cap seems insignificant with light use, but when taking many shots over the course of a few hours, the S100 really shines.Photographers should be warned, however, that the S100 is not a professional-level camera by any means. The 2.1 megapixel resolution, while not meager, is not enough to yield even high-quality 5x7's. Serious cropping of a photo is usually out of the question because of the limited resolution.So, if you will be using your camera as a &quot;fun&quot; camera--for casual pictures--look no further. This is the one. If you're serious about picture quality, compare the S100 carefully to its larger siblings--the S20, and the G1.Overall, a fantastic little camera.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Perfect Camera for &quot;Fun Photos&quot;", "unixReviewTime": 992649600, "reviewTime": "06 16, 2001"}

While the LCD screen is small, you can zoom in on shots in memory (effectively 9x) so it's possible to get a good idea of the quality of any shot. The panoramic mode is incredibly cool - the camera fixes the exposure settings and lets you view the previous shot before you take the next one over.

After getting one for Christmas from Amazon, I'm now a believer:  The Digital Elph is truly the world's smallest digital camera that shoots great pictures.2.1 mega-pixels (2.02 effective, according to manual) is nothing to write home about -- and the Canon continues to take under-saturated pictures -- but the picture quality is top-rate, besting many 3-mp cameras I have tested.  The quality shows when you print the images, even at 5&quot;x7&quot;.  I use an Epson 875DC and the images are many times better than those taken with my other digicams, even under the same shooting conditions.This camera is also easy to use; you can start shooting away after you unpack and charge the included LiIon battery.  The LCD viewfinder is small but very clear.  One good thing: your nose won't touch the LCD when you use the optical viewfinder (unless you have a very small face).  Battery life is decent: I get about 50 shots with all flash and LCD on.  Obviously you get more if you turn off LCD, and even more if you don't need flash all the time.This camera turns heads.  Every time I take it out I can hear people around me talking about it.  Some will ask me if they can hold it.  I'm always proud to tell them that it takes great pictures, too.

Many tips has already been said in these reviews so I'm going to add to it. One review said that the person had tremendous trouble installing the software on a Win98 platform. My first installation was succesfull. I used Win98 second edition to help with the installation. Something you should keep in mind. The SP100 only supports USB transferring of data to your PC. So you need a USB port attatched to your motherboard. The latest boards has a USB port. But the older ones ( which is not that long ago ! ) does not have a port and you have to buy a USB card to plug into your motherboard. I had to do that.The rest of the installation and connection to the camera is mind blowing easy and quickly ! Downloading photo's to your pc is like saying 1,2,3.Then something another reviewer said. Sometimes the photo's tend to be a bit dark. Quite true. But you CAN force the flash to stay on. You also can set the flash on Slow-Syncro mode which adjusts itself to the slow shutter speeds. You can also set the exposure compensation and the white balance.There are a few more things the cam can do. I will name some of them. Shooting continuously, ( 2 images per second until you release the button), a timer ( takes a photo after 10 seconds ), shooting close-ups, stitch photo's together, replay images on your TV (realy cool), and taking black and white photo's.The software is okay...nothing to rave about !

Even with its relatively compact size and rugged construction, I found myself leaving the S10 behind more often than not. It was light, it was small, but it wasn't light enough, and it wasn't small enough.The S100 solves that. For the most part, it is an S10 in a smaller, lighter package. Slipped inside your coat pocket, or hanging off your belt in a case, it's barely noticeable.  But take it out to shoot, and the quality and flexibility will astound.As with the S10, the S100 is easy to learn.  Unlike the S10, there is no secondary display on top to provide information on shooting mode, pictures remaining, etc.  The color LCD on the camera's rear shows overlay menus and stats to provide this. In other digital cameras, this might be a serious negative: using up valuable battery power. But given how miserly the S100 is with electricity, the arrangement doesn't seriously impact the number of pictures you can take.And you can take a lot of pictures.  By adding a larger compact flash card, such as the Viking 128MB, you can capture a short vacation's worth of pictures without downloading.  A choice of three different resolution/compression settings helps conserve memory.  The rechargeable battery (included) will nearly see you through the entire 128MB, depending on how much you use the LCD display for shooting and editing.  With a second battery, you're virtually assured that you won't run out of power during a day out. The recharger is multi-voltage, so with a plug convertor, you can recharge your battery in many foreign countries.The electric frugality also means that you're free to edit your shots on the go, snapping a half dozen or more in any circumstance, and deleting all but the best.  This is great for shooting pictures of the camera shy.  They're assured that you're only keeping the &quot;good&quot; shots.  It also works well with children, as you can provide them the instant gratification of seeing the picture only seconds after it's been shot.  (This isn't particular to the S100, obviously, but its battery life helps!)A few negatives of the S100: (1) the flash slot is CF1, rather than CF2 (as in the S10 and S20), which means no microdrives. (2) The flash is weak, as might be expected in a camera of this size, and located so close to the lens as to just about guarantee red eye. I've gotten some spectacular examples of the latter. With post-processing you can mitigate the red-eye, but it often takes an artist to really eradicate it. (3) The controls are small, and may be difficult for some fingers. (4) The shutter lag is substantial, making it very difficult to capture action (although the continuous shooting mode helps).  (5) The 2x zoom often leaves me wanting. The 2-megapixel resolution helps, as you can often blow up the middle of a shot and still have sufficient pixels for a smaller print.The programmed exposure modes are adequate, and the manual settings can help, but at its heart, the S100 is a happy snapper. Great for snapshots, but frustrating for sophisticated photographers who find themselves in unusual lighting.  The panaromic mode, combined with the photo stitching software works well.One can discuss the merits and demerits of the 2- and 3-megapixel cameras on the market, but if portability is your primary concern, the S10 is hard to beat.  No matter how good your camera, it won't take good pictures while sitting in a drawer.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The &quot;take everywhere&quot; 2.1 megapixel choice", "unixReviewTime": 990662400, "reviewTime": "05 24, 2001"}

I've owned a few 35mm cameras over the years, including one SLR and two point &amp; shoots.  I had been waiting for the prices of digital cameras to come down before  taking the plunge.  This year, with a cruise to Nova Scotia coming in  August, I decided the time was right and just purchased a Canon S100  Digital Elph.  I must say, I think this is the coolest camera I've ever  owned!  First, it really is tiny; the size of a pack of cigarettes, maybe  a scooch deeper.  The included battery charger is larger!  Second, it is  incredibly easy to use.  I just went on a quick photo shoot in NYC's  Central Park today, and what a bunch of beautiful photos I took, if I do  say so myself (and I do!)  The camera is as easy to use as a point and  shoot, and with instant review on the LCD screen, you can retake any  flubbed shots on the spot.  The two-times optical zoom operates smoothly  and quietly, and lo and behold, a two-piece shutter-like cap automatically  slides closed over the lens when you turn the camera off. I also had no  problems installing or running the camera software on my PC.  I'm still  learning about file sizes (and how large is too large to email), and I did  erase one photo I wanted to keep as I was getting used to the menu system.  But otherwise I am thrilled to have taken the plunge into digital  photography.  And there are two more advantages to digital photography  which I hadn't anticipated, beyond the lack of film and developing.  One is  the lack of censorship of your photos -- time for some, uh, fashion  photography of your wife or girlfriend, if that's something you both would  enjoy!  Another is the ability to upload images from your PC to a memory  card in the camera.  This is a great source of personal entertainment for  travelers, if you catch my drift, and you can zoom in on the LCD images!  I  would also recommend Canon's soft case for the camera, which has a slot to  attach to your belt along with a second nicely finished compartment to hold  an extra battery or memory card.  As other reviews have noted, you will  definitely want one or more additional memory cards.  I've found I can get  from nine to twelve compressed 1600 X 1200 photos on one 8MB card, or 28  images uploaded from my PC.  At any rate, if you have been interested in  digital photography but the price and confusion have held you back,  consider the Canon S100 Digital Elph.

A 2X optical zoom (you can pretty much ignore any time a  manufacturer refers to &quot;digital zoom&quot;)Size naturally means  pricey - [and] may seem a little bit much for a point and shoot camera  but but it has one feature which sets apart from all others: it's small  enough that you'll have it with you!  Being a gadget guru - I've owned  about a dozen cameras and this is the first one that I always carry around.The next two features which are equally important in any digital camera  you're considering:2.  Compact Flash Support - Smart Media memory is too  expensive, in short supply, and doesn't seem to be growing in capacity as  quickly as Compact Flash.  So CF seems to be the way of the future in  &quot;digital film.&quot;3.  USB support.  Sure, there are floppy  adapters and serial cables which are cheaper - but they're SLOW!  Imagine  copying a 2MB picture through your floppy drive - it would take several  MINUTES vice a few seconds via USB!  If it's cumbersome, you're not going  to use it.  Not only does this have built in USB support (great for sharing  files w/ other PC's), but Compact Flash USB readers are getting cheaper and  that'll save you battery life when downloading to your own pc.The rest  of these features are all on the same level.... 4.  Rechargeable battery.  While it's more convenient to have a camera that uses generic batteries (AA  or AAA) that usually means bulky and not as efficient.  This camera has a  proprietary rechargeable Li-ion battery that comes with a little device so  you can plug it right in the wall and recharge it.  Very compact, recharges  in about 2 hrs, if you're just taking shots using the viewfinder and  letting the camera show you the shot for &lt;2 seconds (best method) then  you can average over 250 shots per recharge!  If you're using the camera's  LCD to take shots then you'll drain the battery in about 85 shots (not  recommended)5. Built-in lens cover.6.  All metal housing - very  durable.  Except for the Compact Flash door - which is plastic (why! ) it's  a very durable casing - unfortunately I'm a little worried about that CF  door!Comments:**No LCD to view memory status, etc...  However, the  LCD window is used to display information.  Can hardly blame Canon, this  thing is so small there's no place to put an LCD panel!**Very few manual  controls, and image quality settings.  There are 3 settings and on the 8MB  included card you can store 4 / 12 / 46 photos depending on which  resolution you choose.  I'd recommend buying a 64MB card asap, and just  take all photos at the highest resolution - you can always decide later to  scale down photos on your pc...**Playback mode.  I had my first camera  for nearly a year before I realized what a benefit it was.  On the fly  share your photo album in anyone's house in their living room, vice  computer desk - makes it easy for sharing with a lot of people.  The Canon  has a unique feature which allows you to flip Vertical pictures (when you  take shots with the camera held vertically).**Very Quick Camera.  The  Elph has an large image buffer so you can take rapid series of photos  quickly.  Depending on image setting, anywhere from 3/9/45 shots before it  dumps to CF Memory (which takes 3 seconds).  Other cameras don't have this  feature and you might have to wait 3 seconds per shot!**Image Quality.  On a scale of 1-10 I'd give it a 9.  Highest resolution prints decent  8x10's which is about all I'd ask from a digital camera.  It's fixed at ISO  100, so it's not exactly a lowlight camera, but it does fine with flash.That's about it - I hope you enjoy yours!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Who says size doesn't matter!", "unixReviewTime": 966643200, "reviewTime": "08 19, 2000"}

The Apple was actually better in two repects: it turned-on quickly and it showed you what you just shot right after you shot it. The  ELPH will do the latter but you must hold down the shutter button to view  it. But this DOES work even if you turn off the LCD viewing -- great  battery saver.The larger the CompactFlash card that you use, the slower  it takes for the ELPH to turn on. It takes about 2-3 seconds of pressing  the on button plus 2 more seconds till you can shoot a picture.

I bought  a 32mb CompactFlash to go with it and shoot in Fine mode (1600x1200  compressed) and get about 50-60 images.

I find it a bit difficult to manage the very tiny buttons and impossible to read the icons without my reading glasses on. Its size makes holding it steady for long a bit of a challenge (not enough camera body to grip with more than your finger tips). 2) The delay from the time you fully depress the shutter to the time the picture is taken is too long and may yield some fuzzy shots. This is due to the unusually slow autofocus system. 3) The lack of an intermediate resolution setting, as other reviewers have suggested, is a problem, but that problem is meaningless with a larger CompactFlash memory card (I got a 64 meg card for $... and it holds 105 pics at 1600 x 1200 res). 4) The camera gets really hot when you are busy snapping away.

The S100's image quality rates in the middle of its class, but it can still be a reasonable choice for students, families, or small businesses looking for an ultra-portable camera that weighs less than half a pound with media and battery pack.The jury rated the S100's prints in the middle of the pack, but its overall image quality results fell at the low end of the midlle for 2-megapixel cameras. Color balance measured better than average, with a noticeable blue cast in images shot under outdoor lighting conditions. Though the S100 only offers center-weighted metering, we overcame a tough indoor-exposure situation by using both exposure and focus locks. Other 2-megapixel cameras offer a more powerful zoom lens and more image-control settings.The flash worked fine for shots taken at the maximum-rated distance under indoor lighting conditions, but it overexposed images taken inside at the minimum-rated macro distance. We were impressed with the sharpness of macro images captured outdoors with no flash. Standard shots taken without flash under outdoor lighting conditions showed slight underexposure but accurate color. The S100's panorama mode worked effectively, as did its burst mode, in which we captured one shot per second at the high-resolution and high-compression settings and three shots every 4 seconds at the high-resolution and low-compression settings.The S100 feels balanced in its shiny stainless steel case and flattens to a smooth, flat box when the lens retracts; an integrated cover protects the lens when retracted. External control buttons are minimal, because you adjust most of the setting through menus, but, unfortunately, the relatively small LCD and small menu font present an operational challenge.The S100's bright LCD displays a graphical menu system which attempts simplicity, but misses the mark and leads you back to the User Guide to clarify navigation and features at every turn. It can be frustrating to use the small LCD to take advantage of the camera's effective panorama mode, but better that than using the viewfinder in this mode. The S100 can be ready to capture your first shot in 3 seconds and subsequent shots every 7 seconds.Compared to others in its class, the S100 is well equipped and designed, with both a USB interface and convenient access to batteries and media when the camera is mounted on a tripod. The included software bundles together a valuable mix of applications, particularly the effective image-stitching software for panorama-mode shots.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "not bad--for better quality pics get 3.1Mpix or higher", "unixReviewTime": 985564800, "reviewTime": "03 26, 2001"}

If the lens was not up to the highest possible degree, I would have kept the review at 4 stars, based on my bad experience after purchasing my first lens.  It exceeded all of my expectations once I received a fully functional lens.  I will try to explain how in the following review.I have now used this refurbished lens to take (at time of this review) around 700 pics in the last couple of weeks.  I could not wait to update the review.My initial impressions are extremely positive.  Most reviewers have already gone over how the lens feels sturdy, the focus ring is smooth with a nice throw for easy manual focusing, and how the lens is tack sharp.  I could not agree more.  After getting a working lens (the autofocus now operates as I would expect) I can report that all of these statements are true.  The thing that struck me the most, though, was the accuracy and speed of the autofocus system.  At macro range, it will track an object and keep it in sharp focus even though my hands are twitchy and the subject may be moving around.  There are a few moments where the focus will stop tracking, but a quick retap of the autofocus button will resume the search.  As was stated in one of the comments, the autofocus does not like going from macro range to standard range, but this is a good thing.  It tries to anticipate where the focus will be, instead of hunting all over the range.The sharpness of this lens is the next massive asset in this lens's bag of tricks.  The level of detail you get from pictures taken in a standard magnification range is absurd.  Every line of every feather is in sharp contrast on a bird (assuming you can get close enough to fill a good portion of the frame at 100mm).  Get close and the smallest details pop out.  The tiny hairs on a grasshopper are present in the photo, and compound eyes become a nest of interwoven latticework.Because this is a 100mm lens, in theory, one only needs to be 1/160sec on a 1.6x crop lens to avoid visible blur from camera shake (not sure if this translates to macro though...) which means you can hand hold this lens in moderate light (I have a very good amount of keepers at 1/160th).  My recommendation, though, is to have a flash unit.  I have a 430 ex ii which has been wonderful.  I do not miss the lack of image stabilization on this lens due to the fact that I mostly use an external flash.  I have tried to use the lens without a flash and unless you have fantastic natural light you're better off with a flash.  Also, some claim IS assists in composing and framing.  Composing a hand held shot is not difficult to me, even at maximum magnification and without IS.  As I stated before, my hands are shaky, too.If your photos require a close up perspective, this is a fantastic option.  The results from a working version of this lens speak for themselves.  In the first 5 minutes I was hugely impressed, and with a small amount of experience my love for this lens has only grown.  I have also used the 100 f/2.8L which is very similar to this lens, but with the addition of IS and a red stripe (ok - a few other things, too).  In practice, I have not seen an appreciable difference between the two lenses.  The non-L is good enough for me.Hope all this helps!---------------------------------------------Original Review:The autofocus on this lens did not operate.  It would hunt for focus for a few seconds and then stop trying.  This was the case in all light levels.  I also tried this with multiple focus distance limits (the switch on the side) as well as multiple camera bodies.This is so sad because the lens has so much potential.1.  The pictures taken really are tack sharp.2.  The auto focus ring is smooth and has enough throw to finely adjust as needed.3.  The lens really opens up a world of fun in your photography.  I found myself shooting everything I could to \"test\" the broken mechanism.  It was hard to send back, even though I knew it was broken.As far as the return process, I purchased this from Amazon, sold by Adorama (a company I've followed for quite a while and have trusted).  They claimed that because I did not purchase directly through them (but rather on Amazon's site) I could not receive an exchange for a working unit.  I could only return for a refund.  They were going to charge me retroactive shipping from them (\"free\" on the original order), a restocking fee, and I had to foot the bill to ship back to them.  WHAT?!?  After a [mostly] calm conversation with their phone support I was told I would receive a full refund and a shipping label to ship it back.  I'm out no money for a defective product shipped to me, so I'm now a happy camper.Since the refunded money has already been reallocated, I now have to save up for this lens again...It's that good that I wouldn't go without it for too long after briefly having it in my possession.  Thus it hurts to give it a 3-star...I just can't give higher without receiving a working unit.  :(", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "First was DOA.

The bokeh is fine. The lens is pretty fast. f2.8 to f22 is useful as a creative range. The optics are sharp and the all-time focusing is a boon. So what's not to like?Well, here's the thing. The Canod EOS40D, which I use, has the ability to use the viewfinder in \"live preview\" mode, and when doing so, will allow you to zoom in on your focus point (or anywhere else, but that's irrelevant to my point here) such that you can see extremely fine detail. At which point you can manually focus the lens so that it is exactly right. Marvelous, right?It would be. But the lens has some mechanical backlash problems. Let me explain backlash; if you're not familiar with it, it takes a bit of describing.Backlash is a problem that occurs in gear trains or arrangements that causes the finest adjustments to repeatedly over or under adjust, depending on which way you are going, because the gears don't (can't, really) fit perfectly together.In a standard gear train, the gear teeth have a little bit of freedom to move before they make contact with the teeth of the next gear in the gear train, and this causes movement of the gear to be without resistance.The gear turns relatively easily, because it isn't actually engaged, and then when the teeth actually make contact a fraction of a turn later, they \"slam\" together and more of an adjustment is made than one would expect.Which in turn requires adjusting the other way, but now the gear has to move back across the non-engaged space and slams into the tooth behind in just the same manner. This can result in a VERY frustrating experience.So now we get to the issue with the lens. The focus adjustment has a noticeable backlash problem which becomes evident at the very highest magnification of the EOS 40D's live preview.I recently took a picture of a small creature (about 50 thousandths of an inch across) on the wall of my salt water aquarium. I used live preview, max magnification, and manual focus.Let me tell you, this was an experience of great disagreement between the lens and me. I spent literally ten minutes trying to get the lens to the best possible focus.I would touch the lens ring, and the focus would get sharper, and then frustratingly, slide right past that setting to slightly blurry again. I'd then adjust the other way, and the same thing would happen again the other way.The camera was on a tripod, it was orthogonal to the plane the object I was trying to focus on was attached to, the object was agreeably motionless - all the recipe ingredients for an easy to focus situation. Except we are talking about a VERY small object, and so very fine focus control is required.Is this going to bother you in your application? Probably not, unless you shoot very tiny things, as I do from time to time. Even then, we're talking about trying to squeeze the very last wisps of focus accuracy the lens is capable of out of it.But after spending almost $500 on a lens, would you not want to get all you can out of the optics? I know I do. If what you're shooting is moving, you could easily lose the best possible shot because the focus is just about uncontrollable in that last percentile or so.It is possible that I got a bad lens; perhaps others would be so good to check this out before they post their reviews. But I have to review the lens I have, because that's the experience I've had.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A great lens, but not quite perfect", "unixReviewTime": 1192406400, "reviewTime": "10 15, 2007"}

It is really a good lens and you will often see people comment on the fact that it may be one of those special lens' that could be L glass but gets away with being reasonably priced.Build: This is a solid well built lens. Its mostly metal construction ensures that it will last a long time. The focus ring is of course rubber and is easy to use. However this lens is heavy, so much so that if you are handholding it and using manual focus your camera holding hand will get tired. I have attempted to do this with a 430EX flash mounted on top and it is literally hand cramping after a while. You will most likely want to purchase a tripod collar with this lens, as a lot of focus will be lost due to camera shake.AF: This lens isn't the fastest lens on earth, and in conjunction with an XTi I find that it is sometimes annoyingly slow. It also tends to hunt a little in all but the best light conditions. Another reason to get a lens collar and use a tripod. However I rarely use autofocus with macro work, and prefer the control of manual. Given the shallow depths of field, manual is much more useful. Also the only time you really need a fast AF with macro is outside shooting bugs and such, and you will probably have the light of the sun which would of course be plenty to ensure the AF functions as you want it to. I wouldnt pass this lens up on account of the slightly slow AF.Picture Quality: I find that this lens produces incredibly sharp pictures (again, do not expect really sharp pictures hand held, I feel like a lot of people complain about this, but dont realize its their fault, not the lens'). The saturation and general color is amazing, and I rarely find that I have to up the saturation or vibrance. Personally I have found this lens to be tack sharp at f/4, and it stays there most of the time, as f/2.8 is a very very shallow depth of field.In Comparison: Although I do not own the 60mm macro, I have had a chance to use one, and although the 60mm is more versatile (i.e portraits), I would not give up the reach. Even at 100mm I find myself wishing I had the 180mm L lens. But 100mm is certainly better than 60mm. This is definitely a macro lens, if you also want to do portraits get the 100mm and the 50 1.8. Personally this is a better choice than loosing the 40mm.Overall: amazing lens, you will be satisfied if you are looking to do macro and some portraits if you have enough room (outside). The only reason I give it four and not five stars is the slow AF in darker lighting situations. But you can work around this.

When I'm not using a zoom, this is my walkaround lens for people, relatively tight scenes and even indoor sports. Think of it as a great lens that also shoots macro than the other way around. Hard to beat that versatility at the price.But it comes into its own at close distances. If you've never had a macro lens, you'll run around shooting everything in sight because everything looks new from a macro perspective.Canon has several macro lenses. I prefer the 100 mm over shorter lenses because I don't have to get quite as close to that bee or wasp. The 180 mm gives you even more distance from your subject, more background blur and amazing sharpness. But it's much more expensive and in most cases you'll need a tripod, and I shoot a lot of improptu macros as I'm hiking.For extreme closeups with larger-than-life images, there's the MP-E 65. It goes up to 5X, compared to the 100mm's 1X, but you lose autofocus with this lens. In fact, you set your magnification and then move the camera until the object is in focus! As you get beyond about 2X, the viewfinder gets fairly dark. If you're doing still life macro work, it's amazing. I'll probably get one someday for shooting my mineral colletion.One thing to keep in mind with any macro is that because of the close distances, you're often in lower light conditions. Althought it's fairly pricey, I'm using the MT-24 EX, which lets you adjust the direction of the twin flashes.

If you're an experienced photographer, just consider the 5 stars and read other reviews.The quality of this lens is great. As many reviewers have pointed out, the image quality is sharp and the colors excellent. This should come as no surprise, macro lenses are usually some of the best lenses made. And of course it focuses all the way to infinity as well, so that you can use it as a \"general purpose\" lens.Depending on what you use the camera for, this is probably not a carry around lens. The 100mm focal length (equivalent to 160mm on APS-C sensor cameras such as 20D) makes it difficult to use it - I find myself having to move back and reposition myself very often, and may result in a missed opportunity.A few other accessories will come in really useful to get consistently good macro photos.- A stable tripod- A remote release cable- External flash- Books about photography, if you don't have them alreadyI have the first, just bought the second, and thinking about the third. Amphoto has some very good books on photography. I find \"Understanding Exposure\" by Bryan Peterson to be very well written and easy to read.A remote cord will prevent camera shake when pressing the shutter. I've tried using timer mode to compensate for the lack of a remote cable release. The problem with that is that when the timer goes off, the breeze that died down may have picked up again, and my carefully framed flower is now halfway out of the photo, and is blurry as well. I never realized how windy it is in my backyard until I tried taking macro photos of plants.Why a tripod? To achieve maximum depth of field (more areas in sharp focus), you need a small aperture. A small aperture means a slower shutter speed to get a correct exposure. Boosting the ISO too far will result in noise. That means that unless there is a blinding amount of light (this is where the flash comes in) you're unlikely to be able to hold the camera still enough to prevent blurring. The only thing worse about a macro photo with only a small area in sharp focus is a blurred macro photo. And remember, stable is the key word. A cheap shaky tripod may not be much better than no tripod.Speaking of light, try not to take outdoor macro photos (or any outdoor photos) under strong direct sunlight if you can avoid it. You'll find the color washed out compared to an overcast day, or early morning / evening. Or you can use a light diffuser, but that's yet another accessory to carry around.As an alternative to a remote release, you can use a laptop, USB cable and software. It is rather more difficult to carry around, and you can get a 3rd party remote release for around 1/3 the price of the Canon original.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great lens, needs more accessories for fantastic macros", "unixReviewTime": 1151712000, "reviewTime": "07 1, 2006"}

The 100mm length gives you a bit more distance when shooting insects which is a good plus, but be aware that this is a fairly heavy lens and not easily handheld (and does not have IS as many of the zooms these day do.) Use of a tripod is certainly recommended when possible as for good macro shots you do often need to stop down and may have to sacrifice a bit on shutter speed as a result. This may not be marked as an L lens, but it certainly is that level of quality.

Basically, the reviews and specifications are similar.  The 100 mm lens is EF while the 60 mm lens is EF-S, so the 100 mm lens is compatible with full frame cameras.  However, most people willing to invest in a full frame camera are probably considering the 100 mm L lens.  My thoughts on comparing the two lenses:1.) Price is similar, with the 60 mm being $100 less only2.) 60 mm lens weighs half as much3.) Both get 5/5 stars with around 100 reviews on Amazon4.) Magnification is the same on both (1:1)5.) You can stay a bit further from your subject with the 100 mm lens at max magnification, 1 ft rather than 8 inchesAnyway, I was unable to decide between the two, and I saw that the 100 mm lens was available from Amazon.  I decided to test-drive it and keep it if I was happy.  My thoughts:1.) The lens didn't seem that extraordinary on my camera, but I was extremely pleased with the results once I looked at them on a big screen.  It's sharp and the colors are beautiful.2.) I thought I'd rather have a 100 mm lens than a 60 mm lens since I already have a 50 mm lens.  However, I think 100 mm is a rather awkward focal length on the non-full frame camera.  It's not long enough to take much in the way of animals and birds, but it's often too long to take pictures of pets or people you're with.  For things in macro, it doesn't make much difference since you're going to be so close to the subject either way.3.) The lens felt very heavy on the camera given that it's a fixed lensFor me, the main argument for the 100 mm over the 60 mm was that I had a 50 mm lens already, and I thought it would be great to have another fixed lens at a different focal length.  The main argument for the 60 mm lens was the weight.

However, when Amazon had a superb deal on the price of this lens a few months ago, I snatched it up instantly.At first, being the novice I am, I wasn't too thrilled about the lens. As someone who WAS accustomed to pointing and shooting with my Rebel T3i, the lens was difficult to use, blurry and slow to focus and I had expected something more out of the most expensive lens in my amateur lens set-up. It took me some time to figure out how to work the lens but this only encouraged me to explore the camera and my photography in new ways.Some things I learned using this lens that will probably be beneficial to beginning photographers and those who are new to macro-photography:First of all, this lens works best with a good tripod if you are using it for its' macro capabilities. Once I learned that, it makes the lens much more enjoyable to use. I find that handheld and with autofocus on it can do portrait and landscape pictures decently. Handheld macro shots ARE possible but I personally find that there are not as sharp as when I use I tripod. There is a noticeable difference in sharpness... this lens can be insanely sharp!Secondly, the autofocus does not work that great for macro mode. This is not a bad thing. I usually turn off the autofocus and focus manually using the screen rather than the viewfinder and then use the digital magnification capabilities on my T3i to really sharpen the parts of the photo I want to focus on. I don't have a remote so I set the 2-second timer on my camera and take pictures that way. Without autofocus on, you can determine what areas of the the photo to highlight creatively and take advantage of its sharpness. This process may be a little slow and tedious for some people.Thirdly, it's not a microscope. I was initially disappointed that I could not stand inches away from an object and look at it's molecular breakdown. Haha. Shows my initial naivete but magnification capabilities from a distance allows you to photograph insects and animals without invading their space.I also use this shot for tripod telephoto shots. It can take some pretty amazing and sharp night shots (with a good tripod!) so I love that it is a very multipurpose lens despite being a macro lens.I love the USM motor. It is a bit slower than I expected but I assign that to the fact that it's a macro lens. It is super quiet and has introduced me to a level of quality beyond the kit and budget Canon lenses I have in my bag. For budget photographers, this can be a dangerous descent into lens acquisition syndrome.This lens definitely isn't for everyone. If you're a stubborn point and shooter with no desire/need for creative photography, this lens may not benefit you and will probably frustrate you. However, if you are willing to be patient and thoughtful, you can learn to make some amazing shots with this lens and expand your photographic creativity. If you dislike having to use a tripod and have money to splurge, there is the much more expensive L, image stabailization version of this lens.I also use this lens for my eBay listings and I feel that it really helps my items pop on the search results compared to competing listings.

For daylight terrestrial photography, the tiny aberrations caused by the wide-open f/2.8 aperture are hardy noticeable and by f/4 the images are exquisitely sharp.There is a lot of glass in this lens - it is heavy.  I highly recommend buying the tripod collar as it allows you to attach the camera and lens to a tripod or ballhead with much better balance.Also, if you plan on using the macro functionality, keep in mind that the effective f-stop of the lens goes way up when you're focusing at very close range.  At 15cm from the front surface, it performs as though it were an f/9.

Keep in mind that this lens may feel somewhat large and bulky to those who haven't used L series lenses before. The extra bulk is because of more high quality glass and the use of more durable materials (metal vs. plastic). I've grown to like the stability and the weight of the lens.The focal length of 135 is not for everyone, on a full frame camera (film or the 5D for example), 135mm is a great portrait lens that allows you to isolate the face instead of just the head.On a digital camera with a crop factor (like the 20D, digital rebels or the 30D), the 135 becomes something like a 210mm lens. This may be too much for  portraiture though it would be useful as a lowlight or indoor sports lens.The only real negative thing I have to say is that the lens cap is very annoying to take off when the supplied hood is attached (not much room for your fingers to get to the releases). {see the customer photos} I generally take the hood off and then take the lens cap off.

I use a Canon 6D full frame and often get pictures which are appreciated by many. Personally, i am very unforgiving on my pics, zoom everything to 100% and like to count hairs in eyelashes. I do little bit of editing on each and every picture in Lightroom or Elements 11.I already have following lenses: Canon 17-40 F/4 L, Tamron SP 28-75 F/2.8, Canon 50 1.4, Canon 85 1.8 and Canon 70-300mm F/4-5.6 IS USM (non L).I used and sold the following in the past: Canon 24-105 F/4 L, Canon 28mm 2.8 IS, 50mm 1.8, 40mm 2.8 pancake.I use Canon EF 12 extension tube for occasional macro needs, have two 430 EX II flashes and Yougnuo 622C remote triggers.70% of my photography is about people/portraits and most of it till date has been covered by Canon 50 1.4 and 85 1.8 (and sometimes with Tamron 28-75 when outdoors).I was speculating buying this lens or Canon 70-200 2.8 IS II. Honestly, i can't buy 70-200 for the following reasons:1) Cost - Most important... i don't have $2500 in my pocket at the moment and can't buy at this price after seeing it for $2200 and waiting for better deal but price moved upwards.2) White color and size although i could have lived with weight if i had money and it were black.3) 1 stop slower aperture than 135mm L although it has 4 stop IS. At times, I can use a tripod or monopod with 135mm and negate its disadvantage of no IS. Personally, i prefer wide aperture over IS and often find ways of reducing shake by supporting my body weight and hands against some object/wall, pausing/stopping  my breath for a few seconds, keeping elbows close to ribcage, etc.4) My main subject most of time is my 2.5 year old who is always in action and 2.8 is sometimes slow to freeze action in average lit home conditions.135mm is very specialized focal length and not very versatile. I will advise people with crop bodies to stay away until it is very careful decision.Even with a full frame, it was a tough decision for me since i use 85 1.8 and 50mm 1.8 a lot which covers me well and felt that 135 could be a overkill.I rented a Canon 70-200 F/4.0L IS just to try what people are raving about. No, that is not my cup of tea. I knew that F4 is slow but still tried because of amazing reviews. Honestly, i believe that lens is only for good light unless you like high ISO pictures, that's not me. Even on 6D, i try to keep ISO within 2000 and mostly under 1600.I also tried 70-200 F/2.8 IS ii in lens rental shop with my Canon 6D, just took a couple of pics and was really impressed once i came home and downloaded the pics to my computer. It blew away the similar shots taken with 70-200 F/4 IS.I practiced to use 135mm length on my 70-300, didn't like it, still pulled the trigger because of 100 bucks off deal on 135 L.It arrived today, now realized that 135mm focal length on a full frame is not bad when it is giving such a fantastic image quality. Its little long indoors and frequently i find myself pushing my back into walls to get some more space. Anyway, i bought it for outdoors and spacious interiors. My 50 and 85 still be my choice in small spaces.I took it in balcony along with 70-300 and shot pictures to compare. 135mm L clearly outperforms 70-300 at 135mm. Also, the cropped picture of 135L was almost as good as 70-300 at 300mm. These pics were shot handheld and remember the IS on 70-300.Although, 70-300 is a good lens in its price range. I will be selling it since it will no longer find a space in my bag when i go out and its of no use at home due to nice primes i have. If possible, i could have kept it to cover that focal range with IS.I am yet to try 135mm with my Kenko 1.4 DGX pro extender.I will be updating my review after a few months of use. Giving 5 stars the very first day since it made a place in my heart on first use. Amazon doesn't allow 4.5 stars else could have rated it 4.5 to start with, even a 4 star can bring its rating down from perfect 5!I wish canon start upgrading longer prime lenses with IS instead of putting IS on  24, 28mm and 35mm primes.My future lenses could be:1) 70-200 F/2.8 IS ii or 100-400L depending on my interests and finances in the future, neither of them will replace 135L or any of my primes.2) Might replace 85mm 1.8 with 85 1.2, again time and finance will decide.3) Possibly replace 50mm 1.4 with 35mm 1.4 L at some point of time to configure my kit better although 50mm 1.4 is an amazing piece of glass.For people on budget, i highly recommend 85mm 1.8 on full frame and 50mm 1.4 on crop for portraits.Finally choosing between 135 L and 70-200 2.8 IS II: This is a tough choice if you have to buy one.Professionals should go for 70-200 for its versatility since they may not like to change lenses too much during an event and probably can justify spending so much.Amateurs: Go for 135mm prime if you wish to create magic/piece of art. Professional photography is mostly about taking pictures that is acceptable to client or exceed their expectations. Being an amateur is a bliss in photography, we can afford to shoot 'when ever we wish' rather than 'when ever have to' and it is easier for us to change lens.------------------------------------------------------------------------------Edit: 30-Oct-13I have used this lens for a almost 3 months and have taken more than 1000 pic with it so far. Here is my observation:1) I find 135mm very good for portraits where you have space for this focal length. As stated earlier, the disadvantage is lack of versatility. It it too narrow when situation demands something little wider and it is always short when situation demands something telephoto. That is where 70-200 F/2.8 IS excels, 135mm demands lens change frequently or you should have more than 1 camera body. If i have 2 full frame bodies, i can put 135mm permanently on 1 of them.2) Although it is F/2.0, i use it mostly in daylight/dawn/dusk instead of low light situations. It is really that good wide open, i use it 90% of time at F/2.3) Although, glass is simply flawless/perfect, still i feel that Canon should think of releasing Mark II, this lens could benefit from following:- Image Stabilization: This is a mixed bag, IS will make this lens better than everything else ever made but at the same time, lens will become considerably costlier and most people won't wish to put so much $$$ in fixed 135mm. Probably, 2 versions without IS and with IS like 70-200 lenses? There could be buyers for both kinds.- I find that it hunts for focus just a little more than newer L lenses, so Canon has some scope for improvement here.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Edit: 16-April-2014:This lens has become the benchmark for judging/evaluating other lenses. I used to love my 85mm F/1.8 USM before purchasing 135mm F/2 L but not anymore. Also, i have lost love for my 50mm F/1.4, 135mm has changed the way i look at pictures, i look for perfection. It can shoot full wide open at F/2, very sharp with no CA or color fringes. In contrast, my 85mm F/1.8 becomes sharp only at F/2.8 and still there is lot of CA and color fringes which i didn't notice earlier when i had nothing to compare against.So, count it as a 'con' or disadvantage for 135mm F/2 L that it will kill your other lenses. My 85mm 1.8 is up for sale, i am retaining 50mm 1.4 just because it my widest prime and most importantly it is 1.4 which i will replace with 35mm 1.4 only when i have money.With the high standards set up by 135mm, i still like my Tamron 28-75 F/2.8 which i really recommend to everyone if you don't have money for Canon 24-70 f/2.8. If i need to live with only 2 lens, these will be Canon 135mm F/2 L and Tamron 28-75 F/2.8Recommendation: Don't purchase it for crop body if you are not sure of the focal length, it might be too long for you. If possible, rent it for a weekend. Without IS, you will be able to use it handheld only in very good light since you will need to maintain a shutter speed of over 1/200 and at the same time, usable ISO capability of crop sensor is limited.

I shoot mostly nature photography and am not a professional portrait photographer, but I was anxious to try this lens out for its famous depth of field isolation and sharpness -- this lens has been reported to be among the sharpest, if not THE sharpest lens that Canon makes.I have to say that my first results were quite disappointing with this lens. I have been using the Canon 70-200mm f/4 IS lens, which produces the sharpest and most consistently in-focus shots of any lens I have ever used. The image stabilization on that lens is fantastic, and adds at least 4 stops of \"hand hold-ability\". I have used it hand-held with the Canon 5D Mark II, the Canon T2i and the Canon 60D and it always produces remarkably clear in-focus shots in available daylight conditions, particularly at the 200mm end which is where I use it most. I was expecting that the 135mm f/2 would be as easy to use, since it is two stops brighter, however I found that the lack of IS severely limits the number of \" keepers\" due to random blurs from hand shakiness. My hands are reasonably steady, yet I was not able to consistently produce the crystal clear shots that I was used to with my 70-200 f/4 lens. Plus, the subjects that I shoot such as plants, flowers and wildlife are very three-dimensional and do not reproduce well at the thin depth of field that this lens produces wide open. You only really get a small portion of the plant or animal in focus and the rest out of focus. Also, the closest focusing distance of 3 feet means that I can't get \"up close and personal\" enough to really fill the frame with my subjects the way I can with some of my other lenses which offer macro or pseudo-macro settings.After my initial disappointment, I decided to try this lens out on a tripod and did some portraits, both using available light and using a bounce flash. The results were like night and day. The shots came out very clean wide open, with the eyes in tack sharp focus, and most of the face in focus, and with the nose and ears in slightly soft focus. The background was just a door but the features were completely blended out and it looks like a professional portrait. The controlled environment is where this lens really shines. When you put it on a tripod you really see what this lens can do. It produces a clean but soft quality that the f/4 lens never can achieve. However, I also have the Canon 100mm f/2.8 macro lens and that lens comes close to producing the same quality of background blur that this lens produces. That lens is also MUCH easier to work with hand-held. I guess the shorter length combined with the much lighter weight makes that lens a better choice for nature photography in the field.I feel that this is a great lens that is showing its age. Maybe it's a Canon \"classic\", but I feel that it is in need of an update. Canon has image stabilization on its 100mm macro and its 200mm f/2 lenses and most of the L telephoto zooms, why haven't they added IS to this lens? Sigma has a 150mm f/2.8 lens that has macro, and the brand new version has image stabilization as well. I recently picked up that lens, it's the Sigma 150mm f/2.8 AF APO EX DG OS HSM Macro Lens for Canon Digital SLRs. You can read my review about it here:Sigma 150mm f/2.8 AF APO EX DG OS HSM Macro Lens for Canon Digital SLRsThe Sigma lens compares very favorably to the Canon 135mm for portraits, particularly on the full-frame Canon 5D Mark II. I shot some portraits using the Sigma lens and I thought they came out even better than with the Canon 135. Plus the Sigma lens has two additional things I really want which is true macro AND image stabilization. I usually prefer Canon lenses over Sigma, but in this case Sigma has now one-upped Canon in this focal range.If you are making your living doing portrait photography you will definitely want this lens. It has some unique qualities. But it doesn't really serve my needs, and I don't think it's a particularly good fit for a walk-around lens, due to its lack of versatility. It's a one-purpose lens, and personally I don't want to lug a tripod to the park or nature preserve. As a tripod-mounted portraits I'll still give this lens four stars, but in today's terms of lens technology it falls short of what many lenses can achieve hand-held.I took the lens out a second time and had the same problem with motion blur that I had before. This is definitely a studio lens. I'm glad I had a chance to try out this lens, but it's not my favorite. That's why I love being able to buy and sell lenses on the used market; it's a practically free way to \"rent\" them, and Canon L glass never really loses its value.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great \"classic\" Canon lens that needs an update", "unixReviewTime": 1310688000, "reviewTime": "07 15, 2011"}

The depth of field is very shallow at f/2. As a result, the background will be compressed.Because of that features, Canon 135mm is ideal for portrait, especially candid portrait, street photography and indoor sports.Build quality is very good, the best Canon can made. The lens is not as big and heavy as telephoto zoom.But unfortunately, this lens does not have Image Stabilization built-in. Image stabilization in telephoto is quite important so you can shoot with shutter speed lower than the focal length X crop multiplier. For example, when you attach this lens into crop sensor camera such as Canon Rebel series or X0D series, then you need to set a shutter speed to at least 1/200 or greater to get a tack sharp result. It is also depend on how steady your hand is. If you have steady hand, then 1/160 will be adequate.This lens have a decent closing focus (1m) this is better than most of the telephoto zoom range. You can also get a extension tube to get the focusing even closer (.6m with 2x extension tube). Therefore, this lens will be quite good for macro photography.ApplicationThe application of the lens will be quiet narrow. Candid photography is one in my mind when I think about this lens. It is because the telephoto range, maximum aperture, and the size is not that big and obtrusive.The second one will be close-up and head-shoulder portraiture, and then for indoor sports such as volleyball, basketball and so on.The downsideThis lens does not have a wide range of application because the inflexibility of fixed focal length lens (prime lens).Although the focusing is quite fast, but it is not as fast as EF 50mm f/1.4 USM or EF 85mm f/1.8 USM. The AF tracking is poor. So in the fast action sport, expect to miss some shots.Other alternatives:Other lens that you might consider to buy is Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8 L or 70-200mm f/4 IS.They are similar in price. the 70-200mm f/2.8 has more flexibility but bigger. The 70-200 f/4 L IS is great because it has IS but you don't have the luxury of big aperture. The weight of f4L lens is almost the same, but the length is slightly longer.Other 'budget' telephoto primes alternatives: Canon EF 85mm f/1.8 and 100mm f/2. Both are not as sharp and detailed as the Canon 135mm f/2 but when stopped own to f/2.8-4 they will impressed you.In conclusionYou will love this lens if you are into close-up portrait, candid photography and indoor sports shooters. With extension tube, you can transform this lens into a macro lens.Is it worth it? This lens has a limited application, so if you are specialized in candid portraiture or indoor sports and want the sharpest lens. This lens is definitely for you.If you are looking for more versatile lens, then investing on high quality telephoto zoom lens is a better decision.

For portraits on my 5d mark2 I much prefer a simpleCanon EF 85mm f/1.8 USM Medium Telephoto Lens for Canon SLR Camerasfor less than half the price. However the lens that eventually replaced this wasCanon EF 100mm f/2.8L IS USM 1-to-1 Macro Lens for Canon Digital SLR Cameras, for about the same price. I really like tack sharp resolution and both of the lenses I kept do just that with a great Bokeh in my opinion. I think that this is probably just an old design, which just does not keep up with the nicer digital sensors. It may be OK on some smaller and older APS-C sensors, but I just do not like the sharpness, especially that it missed way too many times for me. I gave this lens as much time as I could, but in the end I am much happier with the other two lenses, which serve me very well. And in the end you could probably stop it down to F4 and I think the sharpness will get pretty good, but then why am I paying for an F2 which by the way 100mm macro does tack sharp at F/2.8 with beautiful Bokeh, but it is a much newer lens design.4/12/2012 Edit:Upon reading the comments here I have given this lens a few more chances. Here is what I have found:1. There was a user error and I was asking this lens to do what it was not designed to do. Namely I used it to close near it's MFD which it does poorly ( especially on my 5d m2 ).2. I was demanding exceptional sharpness wide open. Not on a $1000 lensBarring these two I find this lens a great choice for some situations. Namely if you want a lens similar to Canon 70-200 F/2.8 IS II, but with half the weight and half the size and black stealth vs white glare, I find this lens very useful. If I have to shoot in the dark at 2.0 I just accept the sharpness loss. In the day I use it between 2.8 and 4.0 and as long as I don't have to have the zoom it saves me lots of weight and size as well as it's much more stealthy. Yes the build quality is very good, but filter size sucks. Though I think the new 24-70 m2 will be the same size.

The 70-200 is $1300 more money!Cons:Now what people have to consider with the 135 is that being a fixed lens, you will be doing a lot of moving back and forth, and that takes some getting used to. Not to mention, if you have a cropped sensor camera (about anything that's not a 5D or 1D), this lens will probably be too long for you, since it will be over 200 mm. Even with a full frame sensor, I still have to get some big distance to take full body shots. This lens is more for head and shoulder shots. It also does not have the Image Stabilization, so you have to be pretty steady if you are shooting at slow shutter speeds. That's not too much of a problem if you have a good ISO, or shoot in decent lighting most of the time. I can get tack sharp at 1/60, and just shot a great window light pic at 400 ISO, 1/60, and f2/0, so it does fine indoors.I already have a 24-70 f/2.8 on another camera, so I don't have to switch lenses if I'm doing a wedding shoot or something.

But some more details influencing  my decision is that I already have the f/4 70-200, so I've got the same focus (though not the extra stop, nor the IS, which would be awesome!)I don't think a person would be disappointed to go with either lens, but I'm just here to tell you that I'm extremely pleased with everything about the 135mm.

It means having the stop you need to rip a hand-held shot that you only get one crack at.  It's native task is people pictures, so when shooting candids you either get the moment or you don't, and with this one f2.0 means you can get it in available light.  I don't like spooking/annoying people with a flash.  This lens lets me shoot from the other side of a normal room, outside of people's personal space and possibly outside their notice. In a larger room, you get tight groups of people.  It's probably a touch too long on a crop-sensor body, but this is such a sweet lens that it would be worth it to rent one to see.When you aren't shooting candids \"in the wild\" and switch to posed portraiture, it gets even better.  Fast to focus, nice perspective, but you might have to \"frame with your feet\" to get everybody into the shot.The weight is quite reasonable and the handling is sweet.  There is a break point in lens weight for me.  This one is light enough to shoot comfortably a long while.  TheCanon EF 24-70mm f/2.8Lby comparison is just over that line, that one is a touch on the heavy side and not as sweet to work.

You can use combinations of the tubes to get the camera as close as you need.  As with all macro setups, depth of field is razor thin.  The solution, if your objects do not move, is \"focus stacking.\"  It does for focus what HDR does for exposure.  Focus stacking software combines multiple images and uses the best details in the combined image.Extension tubes are highly demanding of the lens.  You need a bright, sharp lens to use them effectively and the 135L is both bright (f/2.0) and sharp.I have gotten some other-worldly macro shots this way.  The detail is so good and so visually enticing that it has you checking out the cost of 16 x 24 inch and larger prints.Since I shoot people more often than macro, the 135L plus tubes is a better match for my needs than using a slower-to-focus dedicated macro lens when shooting portraiture.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Perfect for \"head hunting\" and more.", "unixReviewTime": 1266364800, "reviewTime": "02 17, 2010"}

I initially had some reservations about this particular lens, but it's been excellent since day one and I'm glad I bought it.  It has earned a permanent place in my camera bag, and I highly recommend it.  Here's why.So many versions of the 70-200mm L USM lens are available.  You can get it with or without IS, as f/2.8 or f/4, and now the f/2.8 IS USM Mark II model is on the market.  The f/2.8 versions are quite a bit more expensive, and from what everybody says, heavy.My camera is a Canon 50D.  I try to only buy lenses that have an aperture of f/2.8 or faster, but the outstanding price of this L lens together with reading all the complaints about the weight on the f/2.8 version were enough to persuade me to buy this lens.  I really haven't noticed much benefit from Image Stabilization on other Canon lenses I own, and actually find that under low-light conditions IS can sometimes cause the AF to hang-up and flash a \"busy\" message, so I didn't see the need to pay extra for the IS version of this lens.  I just planned on using a tripod all the time with this lens.....turns out that under most conditions, this is not necessary.My first photos taken with this lens were hand-held and under low light, and the color and sharpness was fabulous - just what I've come to expect from L glass.  A few days later went out for some landscape shots and forgot to bring my tripod.  Again, excellent color and clarity, and no blurry shots at 'reasonable' shutter speeds.  For landscape I found I could get a decent panorama at 70mm and then zoom in on a monument at 200mm.  During this shoot I needed to take a few portrait shots, and again thanks to the 70-200 range there's no need to change lenses.  Even at f/4 you can get awesome portrait-perfect bokeh with this lens.Fast-forward to my daughter's first swimming class.  Olympic-sized pool housed in a poorly-lit building, shooting hand-held from the bleachers a couple hundred feet away, so flash is not a realistic option.  This lens nailed every single shot at 200mm - I was amazed!  No tripod, no flash, and out of 42 shots not a single one out of focus or over/under-exposed.  Once again, faithful colors and detail so sharp you can see the water droplets in mid-air.  This lens is quite light for its length - even lighter than my shorter Canon 24-70mm f/2.8 L USM lens.  I've read other reviews for this lens complaining about the weight, but I disagree.  The weight of this lens is never a problem, the only concern walking around is the length (7 inches without the hood).Sure, if I had more money, I'd love to have the f/2.8 version for those moments when you really need a large aperture and the extra weight doesn't matter.  Also, this lens does not come with a tripod ring, and it's a pretty good idea to have on on hand, especially if you're using a battery grip.  There are several cheap ones available, but I've had good luck with the extremely overpriced OEM one:Canon Tripod Mount Ring A II (W) For 70-200mm f/4L Lenses.  And if dust & moisture is a concern, only the IS models have environmental sealing, so you might want to pass this one up.  I rarely go out shooting in damp or dusty climates, and I baby my gear so I should be fine for a few years.

Sharpness, contrast, speed of focus, low chromatic aberration, superb mechanical construction and light weight (compared to the F/2.8 versions) make it a superb choice for a must have Canon lens for serious photographers. I along with others, find this to be nearly as good as many prime lenses (fixed focal length or non-zoom) which is pretty amazing. It works great with APS-C sensor cameras (such as Rebels, 20D, 30D, 40D, 50D etc.) as well as full frame Canons (5D, 5D Mark II, etc). Sample to sample quality also appears to be very, very good -so you are less likely to get a lemon than with some other models.As some other people have pointed out with sensors smaller than \"full 35mm\" you have a crop factor. With an APS-C sensor crop factor of x1.6, you are not bringing the \"subject\" closer -there is no magnification (such as in 10x binocular), you are simply framing the \"subject\" tighter because the image is cropped. The image circle made by the lens is too large for the smaller sensors and edges fall outside the sensor area, whereas with a full frame 35mm sensor it does not.An excellent place to look at lens reviews written by more experienced photographers is fredmiranda dot com. The average rating for this lens on that forum is extremely high.If you can afford it, the IS (optically stabilized) version of this lens has some advantages, but it comes at a considerably higher price.In summary, having used this lens (for fashion and portrait work)-as well as many other lenses, with 4 different Canon cameras, I recommend it wholeheartedly.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Absolutely best telephoto Lens for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1239753600, "reviewTime": "04 15, 2009"}

At longer focal lengths with slower shutter speeds, this can be an issue on this lens..BUT with how well newer Canons are handling higher ISOs, many of the camera shake issues that you would need IS for can be addressed by cranking up ISO and shooting at a higher shutter speed...I won't lie though, IS is a nice addition to a mid-range zoom, but does it justify the cost increase to the IS version?  That will really depend on the user and their financial situation.I use this lens mainly for portraits along with my 24-70 F2.8L.  The 70-200 is a perfect complement to that zoom range, and if you really want the ideal situation, having the 70-200 F2.8 in addition to the 24-70 F2.8 is a great way to go...but, again, cost rears its ugly head when we look at the jump from the F4 to the F2.8 in the 70-200 lenses.I bought this lens because I knew I wasn't going to be using it in situations where I needed IS and because I wasn't going to need F2.8 either.  With those two considerations in mind, you can't go wrong with this lens.  It is pin-sharp throughout the entire focal range and produces wonderful bokeh for portraits.  I use this lens all the time for doing kids portraits and outdoor candids - the zoom range lets me stay out far enough that the child doesn't really know I am taking his picture (that sounds creepy - but you know what I am getting at here if you've done child's photography - the second they know the camera is pointed at them, they often stop being cute and start being awkward).  At 200mm, I get superbly sharp features in the eyes - sparkles are there, eyelash details, etc., while at the same time having wonderfully smoothed backgrounds.  The subject really 'pops' from the background.  This lens is also great for a formal portrait session if you are able to stand far enough away from the person.  So, if you are into portraits and need a mid-range zoom, or maybe just bought a new Canon 7D or Rebel XSi or XS or a used XT series and want some L-series glass at a reasonable price, you can't go wrong here.Some people consider using this with a Canon extender like a 1.4x or 2x.  That I cannot recommend if you want to preserve optimal image quality.  It will bump up the zoom, but your images will lose their L-series quality.  If you already own the extender and just want some extra reach without being too terribly worried about those details, go for it.This lens is also much, much lighter than its F2.8 counterpart.  In my review about the 24-70 F2.8 I recommend that you often go for as much aperture as possible when buying a lens - I still stand by that when the price isn't a big difference (in my review about the 24-70 I was comparing it to the 24-105 - so there wasn't a huge price difference).  If you can afford it and don't mind the extra weight, the F2.8 version of this lens is the choice, hands down.  But if you want a lighter lens and have a specific plan for this lens that won't involve a lot of low-light shooting (like using it in flash photography a lot), I don't think you can go wrong with spending around $600 for an absolutely wonderful lens.Please let me know if you have any questions about the lens, I'm happy to answer what I can.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Can't beat the price for an L-series lens - don't let non-IS scare you away", "unixReviewTime": 1256515200, "reviewTime": "10 26, 2009"}

Let me tell you, I was in the same position:  I really wanted the f/2.8L IS version, but didn't know if spending the extra $1K was worth it or not.  I got this lens (f/4L, non-IS) and am COMPLETELY happy with my decision!  This lens is about as light as an L lens gets, and f/4 is completely acceptable for this level of zoom, I've found.  I'm really glad I saved my money (and put it towards the amazingCanon EF 16-35mm f/2.8L II USM Ultra Wide Angle Zoom Lens).This lens isn't as white as I thought it would be.  It seems to be more of an off-white, but that doesn't bother me.  This is my first L Series lens, and I'm completely hooked!  Everything about it is well-made!  Even the surface of the lens is easy to grip and adjust, and it comes with a lens hood, as does the 16-35mm f/2.8L, so you don't have to worry about purchasing one separately.  I got a good CP filter and an ExpoDisc for the lens, and that's really all you'll need for a modern camera.

Don't waste your money on the f/2.8L or IS versions unless you really need it and can afford it, in which case, you probably wouldn't be considering this lens!  Keep in mind a couple things:  The other versions of this lens will be heavier and larger, so will be more difficult to carry.  Also, a 70-200mm on a 40D or Rebel will actually be 112-320mm, as most Canon digital cameras will have a 1.6 \"crop factor\" compared to the more expensive 5D or hyper-expensive 1Ds Mark III, which are full-frame cameras.I am completely satisfied with this purchase and would make the same decision again!

Simply put, it is not like any other zoom lens I have ever owned. I can honestly say that this one is equal to some of Canon's better, consumer-grade primes (although slower). And for a zoom lens, this is somewhat of an accomplishment. Then again, this IS my first L-series lens. So maybe this is what I have been missing. Regardless, I would take this les over ANY Canon consumer zoom. Alot, for instance, has been said about this lens vs the 75-300mm. But this is how I look at it. Image stabilization is a high cost option on ANY Canon lens. Do you REALLY think that the optics on an image stablized lens that is the same price (and with a wider zoom range) as a non-image stabilized lens is going to be as good as the non-image stabilized lens?

It also  beat the pants off the sharpness and contrast of the 3-times as heavy and 3-times as costly 70-200 f2.8 IS at the same f-stops (4 to 4, 5.6 to 5.6, etc) for all but 200mm, where the IS had virtually the same (but not better) image quality.  It also works wonders using the 1.4X teleconverter, becoming a super-sharp 98-280mm f5.6 zoom with fast and accurate autofocus.  This lens seems to get a very high percentage of rave reviews from owners and for a reason.  You get the best quality images and build with the most portability (low weight) for the lowest cost.  Yes, you can spend twice as much for the f2.8 non-IS version and haul 3-times the weight just to get one-stop.  Or, you can spend 3-times as much and haul the 2.8 IS for a Gold's Gym workout to get low-light performance (but maybe lower image quality from my experience).

You will only be able to capture the head and part of the torso of one person.  Instead, buy the 28mm f/2.8 or the 35mm f/2.0 focal length lenses (stay away from the Sigma 30mm).With that said, this lens is awesome for low light indoors and outdoor night work.

Some are much better than others though, thanks to better optical designs that more effectively correct for this tendency.  The 35mm f/2, for example, is very good wide open; the 85mm f/1.8 is decent (and very appropriate for portrait use).  My copy of the 50mm f/1.8 lost both sharpness and significant contrast as f/1.8 was approached.  I would quantify it as follows:f/1.8: very fuzzy (well beyond \"soft\"), reduced contrast, almost un-useablef/2.8: still quite soft, much improved contrastf/4: slightly soft, good contrastf/5.6: sharp, good contrastf/8: very sharp, good contrastThese results were repeatable on my sample and held true regardless of shutter speed and technique.Notes:- The advantage of a lens like this is the ability to use wide apertures.  A good portrait lens need not be particularly sharp, but wider than f/4 my copy of this lens was soft enough that I would use it for nothing other than casual people-photography.  It would not suffice for critical night or low-light photography, or for general photography where sharpness might be desired.  For photos of people it was fine at f/2.8, but below that it lost so much sharpness, and enough contrast, that photos of almost any subject looked dull.- The lens seems like an obvious choice as a first prime due to its price and the many excellent reviews of it here on Amazon and elsewhere.  Even besides the sharpness degradation wide open, I found it less useful than I'd hoped.  On a crop-size DSLR, it is a short telephoto lens, and it just hasn't turned out to be a focal length I use all that much.  I would urge potential buyers to consider the 35mm f/2 before this lens as it gives the traditional \"normal\" perspective on a Nikon crop-size DSLR.- Some reviewers like this lens for portrait use, but again, I found it poorly suited for this.  The 85mm f/1.8 is admittedly more expensive, but it has far more potential as a portrait lens.- This is not a high-contrast lens.  It does not use any ED glass elements, which seem to be quite magical at improving contrast, and color rendition is noticeably less vibrant than such lenses.  For some types of photography this can actually be desirable, but for general or landscape photography I prefer the higher-contrast lenses.- My sample of this lens may have been below average, considering that most reviews of the lens are very positive.  However, if you read carefully, most thorough reviews do mention that it loses contrast and acuity at wide apertures.  Ken Rockwell, for example, has reviewed the lens very positively, but when it came time to suggest lenses sharp enough to be used on the new D3x, with its ultra-high-resolution sensor, he gave the similar-performing (possibly better) f/1.4 \"G\" version only three stars.  I would submit that it is really not quite as sharp a lens as its reputation would lead one to believe.  My excellent 16-85mm DX zoom, for example (the only lens I've given a five-star review as of this time), is far sharper than this lens up to around f/8 and hold an edge even there and beyond.- Nikon has recently announced a new 35mm f/1.8 DX lens.  I've ordered one and will probably post a review once I've had a chance to use it.  I would suggest that it is very likely to be a better choice than this lens for almost any DX user.  Being designed for the smaller DX sensor, it will probably be optimized for high linear resolutions within the smaller DX image circle.  It is also a fairly inexpensive lens, not much more than this lens now that the 50mm has crept up a bit in price.- Even if my sample is significantly poorer than average, my experience indicates that it would be a good idea to thoroughly test a copy of this lens before committing to buy it.  Be sure to compare images at wide apertures to those made at f/8, where sharpness should be very good, and determine for yourself whether the loss of sharpness and contrast is acceptable for your purposes.- Focus is plenty quick and accurate, at least on my sample.

I agree. I also have a D40 and used this lens on it. The focus action is stiffer. Focus travel is short, too. As a consequence the electronic rangefinder inside the D40 (focus dot indicator) flickers when focusing by hand. Purely manual focus (MF) Nikon lens are much easier to focus on the D40. For example, the MF 35-105mm Nikkor smoothly gets in and out of focus without flickering the focus indicator, as does the 55mm f/2.8 micro Nikkor. Both MF lenses have ample focus travel and will nail the focus indicator without difficulty.I shot an event inside the church using ISO 400 film with this lens. Scenes were correctly exposed with only the builtin flash of my Nikon F75 to fill-in nearby subjects. Set at f2, my photos were sharp and showed correct balance of flash and ambient light including candles and chandelier lights. Without the wide aperture of this lens, I would have to resort to a bigger flash gun (inconvenient) higher ISO film (hard to find) or shutter speed slower than 1/60.One other thing I observed with this lens is that it is quite tighter than other lenses to mount on the camera. I am not sure if its just my lens. I read somewhere that someone also noticed this. If you have the same observation, just be careful not to press the lens body too much in mounting it to the camera.As you can see from the picture, the lens body is rather colorful and these markings carry significance. You may not see the same marks on G model lenses which come as the usual kit lens. The depth-of-field scale, distance scale, and aperture readout scale that are written on the 50mm f/1.8 lens body gives important information for those who are new to photography.

The results were spectacular. USB 3.0 drive to USB 3.0 drive transfer speeds are phenomenal.Using a RAID0 (Striped) source drive (10,000 RPM WD Raptors) with a consistent throughput of 160MB/Second I copied 5.0 GB to the following drives:- Standard 5400 RPM SATA (SATA 3GB/Second interface) - Transfer Speed 55MB/Second- Standard 7200 RPM SATA (SATA 3GB/Second interface) - Transfer Speed 77MB/Second- USB 2.0 5400 RPM external drives - Transfer speed 34MB/Second- USB 3.0 5400 RPM external drives - Transfer speed 72MB/SecondUsing a USB 3.0 External Hard Drive 5400 RPM as the source copying to another identical drive on the same USB 3.0 HUB I copied 5 GB of data with a transfer speed of 80MB/Second.

Usb-powered units divide the available power across all the ports that are in use, so the more plugged in, the less power for each. I have a 4-port usb-powered hub that is only good for products that do not need much power. Things that work well in it are powered external hard drives (or other powered devices), a mouse, or a solid state memory device. High capacity/fast portable hard drives without their own power supply don't work well.

If they were horizontal, and close together, some of the wider cables would not fit side-by-side. This is especually true with memory card devices. My sd card adapter is so wide, it would prevent another input on either side of it if they were horizontally oriented. I also like that all the slots are on one side of the unit. It's easier to organize cables when they are all plugged into the same area, rather than into several sides of the unit.3) Smaller and lighter is better. This unit is small and light, but not flimsy. It's the smallest 7-port device I have seen. It can be tucked into any number of spaces, so it fits well into your work space. One feature that would be nice would be a couple mounting slots so I could anchor it to a desk or wall using screws. The only downside of its weight is it can move around the desk, especially if there are several cables plugged in to it.

One of the things I particularly like with it is that it comes with one of the newer \"slimline\" power supplies that doesn't block other plugs, works anywhere in the world (100-240V), and is more efficient than the old \"wall wart\" power supplies.Let me address some of the other comments here:1) For the guy with the Lexar data card... it is a blight on D-Link's reputation that their technical support was clearly incompetent (this is sadly true of many companies today -- being pushed there in part by the relentless \"drive to the bottom\" by consumers who often care more about price than quality and support), but I doubt that even a really good company could have helped much.  Although the hub may have somehow been at fault, it's also possible the Lexar card had problems -- even if it worked fine in other hubs.  For the record, I've used a handful of USB drives with this hub without problems... although not a Lexar brand.2) Regaridng plugging in a USB 1.0/1.1 device and slowing the hub down -- this doesn't actually happen, at least in the hub I received, but what D-Link is doing is hedging their bets (hence the word \"may\" -- which unfortunately these days many manufacturers use when the word \"will\" is more correct!): Inside the hub you'll find a VERY generic hub IC (actually, two of them), and D-Link has a lot of freedom to use different vendors' ICs based on price, availability, etc.  All of them are USB 2.0 hubs, but ones without so-called \"per port transaction translators\" will drop to full speed (12Mbps) if any of the ports have such a device plugged into them.  Happily, ICs like this are pretty much extinct today (when USB 2.0 first came out they were around).  In any case, your solution of just getting two hubs certainly still applies.

I originally reviewed the 7-port grey styled USB 2.0 hub, which is discontinued and replaced with a black styled one with different features, however they are listed under the same product code on Amazon. To make it even more confusing, Amazon has combined the 4 port USB 3.0 hub into the same item, so I can only write one review to cover all of these things. I will leave the original review lower down, but if you are interested in the USB 3.0 hub, then this review up top is what you want.This hub has been really flaky for me. Most of the time it doesn't recognize what I plug in. In order to get it to work, I have to jiggle all the cables around. I don't know if it's the cables that are loose or if there's something loose inside, but it's a real pain.The hub has purple LEDs in it, which only serve to annoy me. I'm not 12 years old, I don't need my equipment to look like a circus.Also, the ports are UPSIDE DOWN. Seriously, this is really silly. Yes, there is a TOP and a BOTTOM on USB plugs, but I guess D-Link didn't get that memo.This item gets two stars, because it didn't catch fire and I can sometimes connect devices with it.=== NOW, here is my original 2007 review for the 7-port grey USB 2.0 hub which is discontinued === I gave it 4 stars back when I wrote that review === Originally titled \"Works well if you don't overload it\" ===I like the way this hub is styled, I have to say that much. Functionally, it gets a passing grade, and frankly if you grade it on a curve against other brands, it does very well indeed.It works quite well, as long as you don't overload it. The supplied power adapter provides 5V/3A which, if you do the math, is only enough to fully supply 6 ports with power. Real world, it supplies even fewer than that. So, this will work well for you if only some of your devices require bus power, but if a lot of them do then you will have problems. I have 6 ports loaded up with a mix of powered/unpowered devices and it works. But if I try to plug something into port 7, it rarely works- just not enough juice.You could probably fix this if you sourced yourself a different power adapter, but let's face it, that would probably cost more than buying another hub.All this being said, I'm still going to buy a second one to supplement my first one, because, quite frankly, it seems like most of the other brands of 7-port hubs are worse. At least this one is perfectly reliable if you don't overload it- no overheating problems, no random drop-to-usb-1.1-speed problems, no disappearing device problems (again, as long as you don't overload it), and it doesn't look terrible on my desk.I have terrible luck with USB devices and this is the first hub I've run into that comes halfway close to working properly, so despite the flaws, this one is worth considering.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Flaky, unreliable, questionably designed.

Disabling the Windows 7 USB 3.0 write cache seems important for reliable connections and non-hangs on shutdown/restart, not to mention loss of data in some circumstances. To check or set this, do this:-- Goto Control Panel->[System and Security->]Administrative Tools->Computer Management->Device Manager-- Click Disk drives-- Rclick \"WD My Passport ... USB Device\"->Properties (or whatever your external USB 3.0 drive is called)-- Click tab Policies-- If you see \"Better performance\" selected, then you should change this to \"Quick removal (default)\" to get more reliable USB 3.0 connections, thus turning off the Windows 7 write cache.#2) HowTo: Ensure the USB 3.0 Controller driver is up-to-date(Updating the driver solved one laptop's problem of the USB 3.0 drive always being disconnected after waking from a sleep/hibernate).-- Goto Control Panel->[System and Security->]Administrative Tools->Computer Management->Device Manager-- Click Universal Serial Bus controllers-- For each USB 3.0 Controller (probably only will be one) -- look for all names that match ...USB...3...Controller...-- Rlick on that controller name, then click Properties-- Click tab Driver-- Find the \"Driver version\" number which we'll refer to as DRVVER (eg. 1.0.19.0 or 3.0.226.3)-- Also find the driver name (we'll refer to as DRVNAM) which is at the top of that Driver tab(eg. \"NEC Electronics USB 3.0 Host Controller\" or \"Fresco Logic xHCI(USB3) Controller FL1000 Series\")-- Do _not_ click Update Driver unless this is an Intel driver, since other brand drivers will probably not be found this way(Windows cannot find updates for most non-Intel brand drivers, and its \"no updates available\" message is misleading)-- Now google for DRVNAM (without the quotes) followed by \"driver update\" or \"driver download\"(eg. google: NEC Electronics USB 3.0 Host Controller driver download)-- Now be careful: only download and install (then reboot) a driver version greater than DRVVER (your current version)and which exactly matches your driver name DRVNAM.

It has image stabilization, and a good range, I thought it would be a good general purpose lens.  I quickly became disillusioned with the results, many pictures where out of focus, so I thought I would compare it against my other lenses.  What I discovered surprised me.  I took the cost effective 50mm lens, the 100mm macro lens, the 70-300mm IS lens, the kit 18-55mm and the 28-135mm and took the same pictures at focal lengths of 50mm and 100mm of a batik (where possible).  I made sure I had adequate lighting to avoid camera shake (1300 watts total, plus all pictures were above 1/50th second), which I thought might be the culprit, and took a series of photos with each lens at f4.5.  The worst lenses by far were the 28-135 and the 18-55 which gave about the same results.  Whilst the 100mm macro lens (from the same distance) and the 70-300mm IS, and often the 50mm showed the grain of the canvas on which the art was imprinted, the 28-135mm and the 18-55 were not sharp at all, and sometimes downright blurry.  This was at a distance of about 2 meters (12 feet).  There were 5 test pictures, in every single one, the 100mm macro lens gave the best result (just ahead of the surprisingly good 70-300IS).  The 28-135 was very disappointing.  I think the sample was wide enough to eliminate operator error.  I wondered if my camera was failing to auto-focus properly, but the results with the 100mm are perfect 9 times out of 10, often even when working at macro ranges with autofocus on, and bad 10/10 with the 28-135mm.In short: Avoid this lens if you want crisp pictures. Get instead theCanon - Lens - 50 mm - f/1.8 II - Canon EF(though some say the f1.4 is better, I might agree, but it's over 4 times the price, and this is definitely a step up from the 28-135), and also theCanon EF 100mm f/2.8 Macro USM Lens for Canon SLR Cameras.  It won't set you back that much more, and you'll get much better pictures and be able to do macro work!  You might argue that the 28mm end would be missing, but the kit lens takes as good photos as this lens, so you're not missing much except perhaps better manual focus, but I would imagine few are using manual focus with this lens.Other problems you may find are that the zoom barrel will extend of it's own accord if you point the camera downward.  I also found that I had to take two or three pictures at a time to get one that was anywhere near in focus and correctly exposed.

If you are a pro (or have such aspirations) or have a large equipment budget, you'll likely be looking for something else.  For those of us who have to make our hobby money stretch a long way, here's my review:I purchased this lens in September of 2007 for use on holiday in Italy.  I've used the lens extensively since, but its performance on the trip was  an incredible trial by fire.  As it was a two week trip and luggage space and weight were at a premium, I wanted to only bring one or two lenses that would cover most of the situations I thought I would encounter.  I chose the EF 28-135 for two reasons:  its range of focal length and the image stability feature.With the typical 1.6x crop factor, I found my outdoor shots of landscapes and architecture rather tight, even at the 28mm focal length.  This is of course not the lens's fault, but rather my choice and my camera's limitations.  Otherwise, the lens was spectacular.  It is crisp, focuses quickly, and yields consistent, predictable shots.At this point, I have to comment on the IS.  Many ruins and almost all churches and museums prohibit both flash photography and the use of tripods.  In the face of these hindrances, the IS was simply a life-saver.  One of several such examples involved over 500 year old tapestries in the Vatican.  They were presented in a darkened room with only muted, indirect illumination.  With the IS (and a steady hand) I was able to shoot them at 1/4s shutter with results, considering the subject, which were nothing short of amazing.  If you're jittery and off balanced, it's not going to do much for you.  But if you need to stretch a few vital stops while using good technique, it is amazing.Pros:-Great value-IS isn't a gimmick.  It works well if used correctly.-Excellent image quality for the price-point-Nice range of focal lengths in a single lensCons:-Barrel extends considerably at the telephoto end with noticeable slop.-For a consumer lens, this thing is huge and heavy.  When you're carrying it with the hood (not included) equipped, people are going to stare.-Not quick, whatsoever.  It's listed as f/3.5-5.6, but you'll be shooting at the higher end of that at most focal lengths.Summary:A great walk-around and travel lens for many circumstances.  In my opinion, the best Canon lens for the novice photographer in terms of both price and flexibility.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A great, flexible lens for the serious amateur", "unixReviewTime": 1206316800, "reviewTime": "03 24, 2008"}

Most of the reviewers and Canonites on the various forums suggested this lens as a good starting point.The 28-135mm IS USM Zoom is the one I use all the time now on the Canon 10D, and that will be the case until I get over the sticker shock of the 10D/28--135mm combo and start adding other lenses to my kit.In the meantime, this lens gets the job done very well.  It gives you good range for a variety of of shots, from portraits to telephotos.  There is even a macro mode, which gives you the opportunity to do close-ups--not really a true macro, but okay for shots of flowers, your kitty cat's face, etc.  It is the flexibility of this lens that makes it so appealing if all you have is just one lens.  And remember that if you mount this lens on a digital camera, like the 10D, the range is actually extended by a factor of 1.6.The USM focuses fast, and the Image Stabilization (IS) really works.  In fact, I've been spoiled by it, and IS is now a must for any of the longer lenses I might purchase in the future.The IS system \"locks\" on target so that camera shake is eliminated or at least seriously minimized.  This means fewer shots ruined by camera shake, and the IS system allows the user to shoot handheld at slower shutter speeds.  This isn't just advertising hype.  It works.The image quality is quite good.  I get good color saturation, contrast, and sharpness.

The USM system is fast and quiet, the full-time manual focus is very helpful when re-selecting a macro target, and the image stabilizer makes for better hand-held shots at slow shutter speeds.  The physical construction has only one flaw: The lens is heavy, and much of the weight is concentrated in the front element, meaning that accidental telescoping will occur once the mechanism loosens up with use.  That's a \"when\", not \"if\", so expect it to happen eventually.That issue aside, it has very good image quality, offers as much zoom range as any hobby or pro-sumer photographer could reasonably demand in one lens assembly, and even produces usable high-magnification shots in the near-macro range (shown as \"Macro\" in the focus assembly's depth-of-field window).  The 1.6x crop factor on APS-C bodies (pretty much any Canon dSLR except for the 1Ds and 5D series) will limit this lens' effective field of view at 45-216mm, even though the curvature and depth of field will still be 28-135mm equivalents.  That's a little narrow on the low end, so the EF-S 15-85mm IS USM lens and EF-S 17-55 IS USM lens should definitely be considered by all APS-C owners before making the final purchase decision, but most shooters won't have any problems with this lens.The lens has a 72mm filter adapter, so good-quality filters (particularly 72mm circular polarizers) will be fairly pricey.  Buyers should budget around $50-75 for a decent circular polarizer and a UV filter/lens protector.  Search \"72mm filter\" on Amazon to see a good selection.Final note: Don't be fooled by Amazon's ongoing policy of deceptive list prices for SLR gear, which they would never charge and no sane person would ever pay.  As I write, Amazon is showing a crossed-out $753.77 as the List Price for this lens, while the inflated MSRP on Canon's own US website is $479.99.  Amazon's current \"real\" price of $359.99 is very competitive, but it is not a \"52% savings\".

At least half of the first 2,000 photos I took with this camera were with this lens.  Many reviews are listed here, so before buying I would recommend looking at a variety of these reviews to see if this is the right lens for your needs.  For me, the lens worked pretty darn good under most conditions, but it's by no means the best nor is it a perfect fit for every user.  Let me explain why.The Canon 50D is my first digital SLR - I just migrated from a set of 3 film Minolta bodies with several high-end, mostly prime lenses.  I've never really liked the picture quality of point & shoot cameras, so the 50D + 28-135mm lens seemed like a good, affordable fit for me.  Since I do mostly weddings and portraits, I knew a good portrait lens was a must so at the same time I boughtCanon EF 85mm f/1.8 USM Medium Telephoto Lens for Canon SLR Cameras, another well-priced lens.Within a week we were off for a month in Vietnam and Korea.  Been to both before but this time wanted to photograph a lot of memories.  The 28-135 is very lightweight and convenient (as is the EF 85mm), so weight or size were never an issue.  The Image Stabilization (IS) is nice to have.  The 28-135 body is plastic, so the feel is a little chinsy but the image quality wasn't bad.  But 'not bad' and 'outstanding' are not the same.Keep in mind that the 28-135 has a variable aperture, ranging from f/3.5 to f/5.6.  If you're ever planning on advancing beyond the symbol icons on the mode dial, venturing into aperture-priority (Av), shutter-prioity (Tv), or other modes, then you're going to need a larger aperture, at least f/2.8 or faster. If you want to use zoom lenses, having a constant, fixed aperture is going to make your life easier and your photos look much better.It quickly became evident that this lens is what it is.  It's an inexpensive kit lens.  Does it blow away point & shoots?  You bet!  Can it take beautiful shots?  Of course!  But my experience is that stellar shots are more of the exception than the rule with this lens.Remember that a large part of successful photography is technique.  Just having a nice camera or expensive lens doesn't necessarily qualify you to work for National Geographic.  The flip side is, if you want pics that are going to knock 'em dead, you have to start with good equipment.  If you're going to stick with inexpensive lenses, you're going to have to work much harder (and take a lot more photos) to get the money shots.  With good technique and with the help of a few other factors (good composition, appropriate lighting, a tripod, a good model or a beautiful scene, the right weather, plain luck, etc.), it IS possible to get great shots.However, for many people, sooner or later the day will come when you realize that this lens can't keep up with your skills or photographic needs.  For me it was about a week into vacation - about the point when I was familiar with my new camera, and I started to see the difference in the photos I was getting with this and the Canon EF 85mm f/1.8 lens.For the price, the package is excellent.  This lens is one of the best values I have seen.  There are days when you just want an easy, lightweight, 'everyday' lens that won't break the bank and wont break your back, and you don't have to worry about the lens getting damaged.  For a lot of people, this lens will be a perfect fit for many reasons.  And I will say it again, you CAN get awesome photos with this lens.But for more advanced users, this lens will quickly become the limiting factor, the weak link in the chain.  Go ahead and buy your camera with this kit lens, get acquainted, and have some fun.  But put some money aside for an eventual replacement.  Canon provides many options, depending on your specialty.  For telephoto zooms, Canon offers a handful of different 70-200mm lenses.  TheCanon EF 70-200mm f/4L USM Telephoto Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Camerassells for under $600 and is the least expensive L-series lens available.  A little more expensive but a good high-end replacement for the 28-135 isCanon EF 24-70mm f/2.8L USM Standard Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Camerasat around $1300.  For wide-angle enthusiasts, tryCanon EF 16-35mm f/2.8L II USM Ultra Wide Angle Zoom Lensor its cheaper cousinCanon EF 17-40mm f/4L USM Ultra Wide Angle Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras.You can see the direction I'm going.  If you want to move beyond the amateur level and get more control of your images, if you want to use some of the robust features of your camera and get more compliments on your photos, you're either going to need one or more prime lenses, or you'll have to go the route of Canon L lenses.  Yes L lenses are expensive, but the color and crispness they bring to your photos is phenomenal.  I started with one, then added another.  And I still have my EF 85 f/1.8.

If you turn past the 'stops' at either end (infinity and closest) it keeps sliding. Basically the ring is simply a rubber sliding strip that's read by a sensor; it's not the direct mechanical interface geezers like me recall. So what appears to be a defect is not.With ongoing use I'm more annoyed by the bulk of this lens. If at all possibly I recommend weighting for a lens designed for the APS sized sensor, not a lens like this that's built for a full frame sensor. It's a nuisance to pay the \"full frame tax\" of excess bulk on a lens that one would prefer to use quite often.I bought this for my birthday and I'm happy with it. So why the snarky seeming title? It's because about 30% of this lens is wasted for most dSLR users. I knew that when I bought it, but I was tired of waiting for a better solution. If you are able to wait until Feb 2007 it might be worth sitting things out.-- ORIGINAL --For the good news see all the other reviews. The one thing I'll add is that you need to think about when and how to use the image stabilization. Unlike IS products that sacrifice pixel resolution, this is an optico-mechanical solution, a spinning lens -- presumably in air or magnetic bearings. Move the camera slightly, the lens remains immobile.If you remember your physics, you can think of times when this won't work. If the camera is accelerating or decelerating too much, the lens will bounce around -- blurring the image. Point the camera straight down or straight up and the bearings may not suffice. Rapidly panning to track a nearby fast moving object may not work. The manual says you should press the button and wait 1 SECOND before shooting. That's conservative (it takes probably 1/5 second) but it's a good guideline. If you need to do rapid panning, use a tripod and turn off the IS (it should never be used if you're on a tripod). If you're focusing on your daughter 100 yards away dribbling a soccer ball you should be ok -- as long as she's not rocketing along. It works quite well indoors and I don't notice it blocking the flash on my Rebel XT.Now the wasted bit. This lens is made for a full-frame 35 mm size  sensor -- the kind that's on Canon's higher end pro digital dSLR and their legacy film camera. The APS sized sensor on almost all of Canon's popular dSLRs (and ALL of Nikon's dSLRs for that matter) is 2/3 of the size of a 35mm sensor. So about 1/3 of the light output of this lens is scattered about the innards of the camera.The result is a magnification effect and wasted glass. The magnification effect is not all bad. A \"normal\" lens for a Rebel XT is about 32mm, so this is basically a normal to zoomy lens. Pretty much the range I wanted. The wasted glass means the lens is 1/3 heavier and bigger than it should be, and the scattered light is sometimes said to cause image degradation (I wouldn't notice).The lens most of us really want is a 28-200mm IS USM Zoom built for an APS sensor for under $500. In other words, the next version of this lens. It would weigh about the same and have about the same f stop and size, but it would have 50% more magnification at the top end. That lens is not available for Canon cameras from any manufacturer. Alas, Nikon has committed to APS sized sensors fully so they DO make something like that.Canon will eventually crack and make the lens we want, or someone else will. So you can try waiting them out. In the meantime, this is a very nice lens and if you're a Canon amateur it's likely a quite good choice.

The Sony is a compact little jewel with a well-made, tight-fitting vinyl case.It takes some time to program (preset) good stations, as there is no dialing, which is probably a good thing. First, I put the 10 best FM stations on Page 1, and the 10 best AM stations on Page 2. These presets can be accessed directly by \"speed dialing\" 0 through 9, or scanned one after the other by pressing Scan. Next I made Page 3 for SW stations. I found on the web the bands that are good at night and day, and began scanning them and writing down strong stations. Letting the radio scan takes time, as it pauses 3 seconds every 5 mhz and there are many bands of mhz to scan. There are very few English SW broadcasts to the US, and I am in the middle of the country, so there is not much at all. I decided to dedicate Page 3 to night SW stations, of which there are enough good ones to fill up the ten presets. Page 4 will be for morning and daytime stations, but there are so few strong daytime English stations that there will be only a few presets on that page.I am disppointed that so many of the strong English SW stations seem to be religious (bible) broadcasts. I think one must take a worldband radio out of the US to hear good English news SW, as little English SW seems to be broadcast at the US. The BBC website says that there is change in listening habits away from SW and its broadcasts to the US are now on satellite radio.I have the included reel antenna stretched out across 20 feet of windows, and a $100  20\" diameter active Sony AN-LP1 folding antenna in one window. They seem about the same, and not a lot better than the radio's own whip. The AN-LP1 will be good where there is only one window to use or no room to string out the reel, but I wonder if it justifies its cost.

Rennie \"Rainguy\"", "helpful": [10, 10], "reviewText": "The Sony 7600GR shines most brightly in the realm of true SW portable radios, top of the pyramid. Only the Eton/Grundig E5/G5, and perhaps the Kaito 1103 are close, but the latter has seriously flawed ergonomics.First off, the Sony is just the right size, that is small enough to carry with you anywhere, even during extended airline travel, but large enough that its controls are widely-spaced and easily accessible. I also own the G5, but find it too small to handle without accidentally pushing some control,  and its buttons too small and tightly-packed. In terms of performance, I get consistently stronger signals with less hiss/noise on the Sony vis a viz the G5; also, the Sony enjoys superior signal strength boosts with the use of a modest external antenna (clearer, cleaner signal with less hiss than the G5). Moreover, the 7600 has synchronous detection to lock in weak signals (the G5 does not), though I have to say I haven't really noticed much of a difference when using it. The Sony divides the single sideband into USB and LSB while the G5 does not; hence, SSB reception was MUCH better on the Sony: many more pickups, clearer signals. However, I'd say that the G5 has a somewhat richer, fuller sound than does the Sony, though it's hardly a night-day difference, But it's there, the Sony having a slightly tinnier, sharper, more \"glassy\" sound, a drawback obviated by the use of headphones.I find the Sony much easier to navigate than the G5 where you seem to be constantly pushing buttons to get around from band to band, freqeuncy to frequency, and the memory buttons are tiny (and require concentrated focus to hit) compared with the big, round, widely-spaced buttons on the 7600 where you can hold the right side and easily punch in changes with your thumb. However, the G5 does have a tuning wheel which is a semi-major flaw in the Sony, though with its 1Khz tuning buttons, you have the same measure of precise control. Still, the tuning knob is unquestionably the best band scanning device.AM reception and FM reception, for me, are slightly better on the Sony, though the difference is slight. On the SW bands, I much prefer the signal strength and low background hiss/noise on the 7600 compared with the G5, especially enjoying noticably stronger signals when using an outdoor-mounted slinky (which seems to inject mainly hiss into the G5). If signal strength for a SW frequency is, say, 3 or 3+ (out of 5) on the Sony, it's generally 3- or so on the G5.As for build quality, the 7600's heft, feel, general overall qualilty of solidity and sturdiness exceed those of the G5. That is, other than the whip antenna anchor which is really loose, almost flimsy. So far, it's held up, but I am always aware of its wobbly base when manipulating the antenna.Now I live on the west coast, the worst place in the country for SW reception, so the experiences of listeners in more lively zones may be wholly different. But for me, after using both radios regularly and doing numerous head-to-head comparisons over about 6 weeks, the Sony is the hands-down winner. The G5 is a good, even very good, SW portable but the Sony is a near-great one.One suggestion I have is this: If you buy a 7600GR (or even a G5, or some similar-sized portable), go to Universal Radio's Web site ([...]) and order one of their clear plastic radio stands which holds your radio firmly in place and at an ideal viewing angle. It's about 7\" wide and costs about 7 bucks. Makes SWLing much easier. I have no connection to this company, but think this is a tip worth passing on.Postscript 3/28. Just read the review below mine, re AM reception. Not my experience at all. My 7600GR picks up at least 20 AM stations with hiss-free clarity, \"5\" on a 1-5 scale. I even get KNBR in San Francisco, 600 miles to the South and some AM station in Calgary at level 4.

I'd buy this again, knowing what I know now.  It's just that I'd be aware of a couple of things that need to be known prior to purchase.  The radio itself is great!  It's well constructed (not some light weight, cheap, thin and brittle plastic cased wannabe short wave radio.  This is relatively expensive and well worth the money. It's been on the market for a number of years, and keeps getting very high marks by such people as ham radio operators who know radios and know what to look for.Sound out of a small speaker is adequate - not worse than one might expect (and shouldn't expect much more).  What's most impressive is the frequency stability - drift is almost non-existent on mine.  Sideband is outstanding, particularly in this price range.  We bought ours primarily for emergency purposes in case of a wide-scale or extended power outage, but it's turning out to be \"fun\" for this former ham radio operator that's still kind of picky.Sensitivity is quite good.  CAUTION: if you aren't familiar with shortwave propagation, study up on it just a bit on the Internet or you'll be very disappointed and do what some other reviewers have apparently done.  Depending on time of day, solar storm activity, and other factors, different bands have different characteristics.  Sometimes you can scan up, and up, and up (or down), and never have it lock on to a single signal.  There are times when some bands are simply \"dead,\" and at other times those same bands (frequency ranges) can pull in signals from all over the world.  This is NOT something that Sony has any control with.  If the band's open, this radio will pick up nicely.One huge flaw is that this is OBVIOUSLY made to make men look stupid to their wives.  We never need instructions for anything - just dig into the box, plug in whatever it is (or add batteries), and use it, right?  That's how we men are!We just intuitively know how electronic and mechanical things work - we don't need no stinkin' manual!  Guys - if you can somehow get to the instruction manual before you even let anyone know the radio's been delivered, STUDY it.  There are just too many functions to be able to intuitively fit on the limited number of buttons on the front of the radio.  So do your homework and you can continue your streak of brilliance in front of your kids or your honey by taking it out of the box, sticking in batteries, turning it on, and start programming the heck out of it after pulling in China, India, BBC, South America, etc.!  (tongue-in-cheek switch / OFF).  Seriously, in order to take full advantage of all the features, this is not entirely a do-it-yourself project.  Read the manual first.  That's not a criticism, just an observation.  This radio is not an on-off, select your band, turn the frequency knob, and listen.  There's much more, and it's part of why the radio sells for the price it does - it's head and shoulders above the price-range competition.Now for the reasons why I did not rate it 5 stars.  There is no external power supply included - and you supply the batteries (all the more reason to take it out of the box before Christmas in order to \"set it up properly\" - there's your excuse so you can read the manual after everyone else has gone to bed).  ;-)  Come on, Sony - at that price, a cheap 6v plug-in power supply ought to be included.Second, and this is a BIG hit on Amazon - DO NOT buy the Sangean antenna listed as \"frequently bought together\" with this receiver.  I got caught on that and purchased something that is IN THE BOX.  It's not labeled \"Sangean,\" but there is little doubt it's the same antenna inside, with just a minor cosmetic difference on the outside (mostly the Sangean label).  It most likely came from exactly the same factory.  Not only does the product description say there are only the internal ferrite bar antenna and the telescoping external antenna on the top of the receiver, with no mention of the plug-in long wire antenna, but the Amazon ad itself says many people buy the Sangean antenna along with the Sony receiver, implying you need to purchase it separately.  The fact is, the external plug-in long wire antenna that appears to be the same thing as the Sangean antenna, is IN THE BOX with the receiver.  Yes, I called Amazon immediately, and yes, Amazon apologized, gave me a postage-paid shipping label, and promptly credited my credit card when the Sangean antenna was received back by Amazon.  In that regard, Amazon was at their usual greatness.  But the ad for the radio (including the extended item description) are misleading or outright wrong.Without those two glitches (the lack of an external power supply included, and the antenna BEING included but being \"pushed\" by Amazon and not listed in the product description), this would otherwise have been a very solid 5-star rating.  Note: we give very few 5-star ratings.  The product has to be way above the competition, virtually flawless, and far more impressive than just \"that's a really great [product].\"  So to say it's otherwise a 5-star rating says a lot about how much I like the radio.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nearly 5 Stars (a couple of glitches - still great!)", "unixReviewTime": 1323216000, "reviewTime": "12 7, 2011"}

One feature that Sony included on many of their more expensive radios was the Synchronous Detector circuit, which can make a big difference in the reception of signals that are suffering from selective fading and/or adjacent channel interference. Sony seemed to \"get this right\" more often than other other producers of SW sets (few even offered it).But alas, the famous 2010 (one of my all time favorite SW radios) is gone, the SW-77 is gone, the SW-100 is gone and this year the highly innovative SW-07 has been deleted.The 7600GR is the only remaining Sony with this feature... I would not wait too long, or it may be deleted as well!Ok, but one feature does not define the radio. I must add that the 7600GR does very well when compared to more modern designs. On AM and Shortwave, reception is quite sensitive, and with the sync detector, the fact that only one bandwith is provided is not a large handicap (many sets have two bandwidths available).FM reception is good but not up to the level provided by the Eton E-5, Kaito 1103 or even the Kaito 1102. LW reception on the 7600 is very sensitive, and it has better \"image rejection\" (fewer false signals) than the E-5 or Kaito 1103. The 7600 does not have a tuning knob, so \"bandscanning\" is not as convenient as on the E-5 0r 1103. Note: the Kaito 1102 does not have LW or tuning knob.In Summary, this is a well-built high quality (still made in Japan) radio that stacks up well against its competition.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Last Sony for sale with Sync Detector!", "unixReviewTime": 1148169600, "reviewTime": "05 21, 2006"}

It is the product ofdecades of development and expertise. Can one radio do everything you've dreamed of (especially forunder $200?) Yes, it can.My perspective includes decades of listening beginning 47 years ago in 1965. Back then, a standardshortwave radio for a casual listener was not portable. It was a five-tube desktop model that simplyexpanded upon tried and true AM radios found in every household. If you needed advanced features andhigh performance, you would need to invest in an expensive multi-tube boat anchor!Times have changed dramatically. The Sony ICFSW7600GR covers 150 kHz to 30 MHz, featuring adouble conversion design with synchronous detection, along with the 76 to 108 MHz ready for FM receptionworldwide. Gone are mechanical pushbuttons. The Sony challenges you to fill up 100 electronic presetmemories! Included is a multi-zone clock displaying local time and UTC. You can choose regular AM receptionor USB/LSB along with CW. A very useful RF gain control and a display light (for night operation) areprovided, as well. The features go on and on!My smiles began early. I was extremely impressed with its operation. The controls are quite intuitive and simpleto master. I entered one of my favorite frequencies, 14.060 MHz (the 20 meter CW QRP calling frequency) andimmediately heard a one watt station calling CQ. The telescopic whip antenna was down with just my fingerresting upon it. There was no shortage of in-the-clear shortwave broadcast stationsto listen to. How do they make a portable radio this selective and sensitive?More early trials produced more amazing results. Again, with no whip antenna extended, I pulled inseveral time reference broadcasts from America's WWV and CHU Canada. Reverting back to my childhood, Itried aeronautical VOLMET weather frequencies and logged New York, Gander, Newfoundland and Shannon,Ireland immediately with little effort. The precision of frequency direct-entry combined with theclarity of the sideband reception was almost unnerving! Plenty was heard on 30 and 40 meter CW. All Icould say was `Wow!'One transmission lives on through the decades. Radio Australia still broadcasts towards the east,covering the Pacific islands and beyond, every morning on 9580 kHz. They have ruled this frequency fordecades with a dominant signal that is hard to surpass. I took the ICF-SW7600GR to work and tried to pickthem up. Radio Australia locked in with full quieting while standing by a window. I walked into the buildingamong literally tons of electronic equipment surrounded by steel and concrete. The signal could still beheard! I know Radio Australia uses a lot of power but this is miraculous.Longwave reception was also pretty remarkable. Again, with just built-in antennas, I logged NDBs (nondirectionalbeacons) FR 407 kHz in Farmingdale, Long Island and OGY 414 kHz near Jacob Riis Park in TheRockaways in Queens. These stations are used as navigation aids and transmit very slow AM modulatedMorse Code continually. You'll never hear a station more anxious to be logged!The ICF-SW7600GR also offers synchronous detection. You can derive a full AM carrier from justone sideband. This is particularly useful if you have a very strong adjacent station or you are trying tomaneuver through digital IBOC HD Radio interference. I often get clobbered by the digital sideband of KDKA1020 Pittsburgh while trying to listen to WBZ 1030 Boston. Synchronous detection can make this noisymess into something quite listenable. It is certainly welcomed at this listening post.This is a sophisticated radio delivered in a classy manner. It is beautifully designed and quite attractive.The ICF-SW7600GR is the size and weight of a somewhat heavy paperback book. Every button and controlwas found in a logical place which could be easily memorized for in-the-dark middle-of-the-nightreception. The LCD display is big and easy to read. With 100 memories, you don't need to do a lot of directtuning. Multiple frequency comparisons are a breeze. Sony even thought of every final touch. The unit comeswith a very attractive black cloth case. Slip the radio into the case and a fold-over leaf covers it neatlysecured with a couple of pieces of Velcro.I'm sure I have only just begun to appreciate everything this radio can do. I'm still mesmerized withdirect frequency entry. There is no noticeable drift and the battery life seems endless. Sony's operationsmanual goes on for dozens of pages. Also included is the 128 page Sony Wave Handbook, a very comprehensiveall-band guide to familiarize you with the world of shortwave and beyond. A cute self-containedreel of wire, with built-in end clips, is included as a useful portable antenna. Sony included everything youneed to get started immediately. You can become a fairly sophisticated worldband listener by just openingthe box. What fun!The essence of shortwave has not changed that much since 1965. All the bands are still there. You'lleven find several new band allocations for broadcasters have come alive. Like visiting old neighborhoodsfrom your childhood, often the flavor has become something completely new. Many of the old standardbroadcasters are hard to find or gone entirely. The Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, Germany and eventhe BBC and Voice of America are missing in action. Many religious stations have popped up along withsome newly dominant Asian broadcasters.As a side note to this review, this receiver can also be used as a fairly accurate frequency counter.Maybe I need to get out a lot more, but nearly everything I use to pursue amateur radio has either inaccurateanalog tuning or dubious digital tuning without reliable accuracy. With a zero-beat accurate SonyICF-SW7600GR around, I can finally discover what frequency I am actually transmitting on!In a reality check, I am certainly aware that this wonderful receiver is really nothing new. Its direct ancestor,The Sony ICF-SW7600G, was first released in 1994 and has nearly every feature the current ICFSW7600GRoffers. This Sony line of compact shortwave receivers can be traced back to 1977 with the release of theoriginal ICF-7600 featuring an analog tuner. The current model employs all the lessons learned from this long legacyto produce a remarkable product. The Sony ICF-SW7600GR is a great deal of fun available for very little money.Get one and enjoy every minute.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Bundle of Joy", "unixReviewTime": 1343779200, "reviewTime": "08 1, 2012"}

Bulk\"", "helpful": [34, 34], "reviewText": "If you want an AM/FM/Shortwave (plus Longwave) radio which is a superb performer yet won't break the bank, this is the one.I can flatly state that this radioSony ICF-SW7600GR AM/FM Shortwave World Band Receiver with Single Side Band Receptionis positively the finest compact portable shortwave, longwave (and AM/FM) receiver currently on the market. I believe that it is the finest compact portable shortwave receiver ever designed.To get anything more capable, you will have to spend a LOT more money - and it is possible that, unless you research the market VERY carefully, you may get something which is not as good!This receiver is simple to operate after reading the owner's manual. JUST MAKE SURE THAT YOU READ IT! Also make sure you UNDERSTAND it! If you do not, or are not sure, then re-read it! Re-read it as often as necessary. You need not be embarrassed - no one else will know how many times you have read the instructions! (It shouldn't take more than one or two CAREFUL readings of the instructions to fully understand them.)You must realize that this is NOT an ordinary analog AM/FM radio where all you do is turn it on, select AM or FM, and maybe change the stations with a knob.This is in fact a sophisticated portable communications receiver and thus requires a learning curve if you are not familiar with shortwave reception. (I have read some reviews here on Amazon's site which clearly demonstrate that the writer[s] did NOT read the instructions! You'll be able to easily spot those for yourself.)If you do read and follow those instructions, this radio is quite easy to use and, by following these instructions (and also by reading some basic books about shortwave listening such asPassport to World Band Radio, 2008 Edition (Passport to World Band Radio)andWorld Radio TV Handbook 2008: The Directory of Global Broadcasting (World Radio TV Handbook)), you will derive maximum benefit from the radio. Once you have learned how to operate this receiver, you will find that using it becomes very intuitive and VERY rewarding! (Please note that the two books mentioned above introduce new editions each year; you can check for them here on Amazon.)This receiver contains just the controls necessary to bring in signals clearly, thereby eliminating much complication that can cause difficulty in use.Its main claim to shortwave fame, in addition to its overall superb design, is its inclusion of a synchronous detection circuit (as well as full single sideband [SSB] reception), available on no other currently available new receiver in its size- and/or price-class. This circuit can make the difference between hearing a station or not hearing it. It can almost totally eliminate interference from a close-by frequency. The circuit also works on the AM band and eliminates selective fading distortion, commonly heard around dawn, dusk, or evenings when listening to distant stations. (The skywave comes in slightly behind the groundwave, or the skywave itself comes in out-of-phase, and causes distortion on other radios which makes an announcer sound as though he/she has a VERY bad cold! This annoyance will not occur on this Sony.)For shortwave listening, it is quite sensitive off its whip antenna yet is robust enough to handle a significant external antenna, should the owner decide to use one.With this radio, the user can easily and conveniently hear, at appropriate times of the day, English-language broadcasts from England (of course!), China, Canada, the Netherlands, Germany, France, Russia, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Viet Nam, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Jordan, Egypt, Israel, Argentina (with some GREAT tango music), India, and many, many more. Also, for those conversant in various foreign languages, there is no shortage of those as well. It is fascinating to listen to news and commentaries from these various countries and to compare equivalent news items. It is particularly interesting to see how some countries will emphasize or de-emphasize certain items and, of course, the varying opinions expressed in their commentaries are of great interest to us here in the United States.ASangean ANT-60 Short Wave Antennacan improve shortwave reception but is not truly necessary. (The Sangean can be plugged into the radio's antenna socket; the wind-up antenna Sony supplies with the radio cannot. It must be clipped to the whip antenna.)Regarding AM performance, this radio is superb. If desired, its AM reception can be improved by means of aTerk Technology AM-1000 Advantage Passive AM Indoor Antenna, used inductively, but this too is not really necessary. Local stations come in, as expected, extremely well, both day and night (especially with use of the synchronous circuit) but what is unexpected is how well this relatively small radio receives long distance stations. At my location, Canada, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic often come in like locals! Other stations from around the country do so likewise. These signals come in loud and VERY clear. One would not expect such high quality performance from a radio this size. And while some other radios in this category may be as sensitive as this Sony, not one of them has the synchronous detection circuit which \"cleans up\" the received AM signal and makes it fully listenable.FM sensitivity, selectivity, and capture ratio are all excellent.This radio has been manufactured unchanged since 2001; its predecessor model (from which there were only minor changes) dates back to 1994. Incredibly, in all this time, no other manufacturer has been able to design a radio even equal to this Sony, much less superior.Its construction quality is absolutely first-rate. It is still manufactured in Japan (for Sony by Towada Audio Corporation, a company located in Kosaka, a town in the Kazuno District, Akita, Japan; they actually developed the radio), unlike all other compact shortwave portables which are manufactured in China (or, rarely, in Taiwan). Japanese build quality has long been noted for it excellence and this difference really shows. Believe me, just a cursory hands-on examination or comparison between this one and any other receiver in its class will confirm that its construction quality is second-to-none (and is even better than some tabletop communications receivers).In order to buy something \"better,\" you would have to spend at least three times the price of this radio and what you would get (the Eton E1, for example) would not be anywhere nearly as portable as this one. (Nor will its construction quality match that of this Sony.)Some people have complained about the whip antenna being somewhat delicate. In fact, all whip antennas can be damaged relatively easily. In that regard, this Sony radio is no better nor worse than any other. In any case, however, the exact replacement antenna is available from PartStore&lt;dot>com. The antenna takes less than one minute to replace.Sound quality is pretty good - great for news/talk, somewhat less so for music on FM. But even this can easily and inexpensively be corrected by means of a cable available from your local Radio Shack that will connect the radio, via its line output jack, to your stereo system. Or, should you wish to use powered auxiliary speakers, thisLogitech Compact Speaker System Z320 for Notebooksis inexpensive and works extremely well. Of course, there are also much more expensive powered computer speakers which may (or may not!) provide better sound than the Logitechs. The choice, as always, is yours. I really like the Logitech Z320s.This receiver can be powered by four 'AA' batteries - either by standard alkalines or, better and far more economically, by rechargeable 'NiMH' types. The radio is very efficient with batteries; a set lasts a very long time and, of course, rechargeable ones can be recharged over and over again.The radio has over 100 memories (100 \"regular\" memories, 2 more memories for the alarm clock function, and one each for the bottom of each shortwave frequency band). These memories do NOT disappear when changing or even removing the batteries. They are totally non-volatile and will remain essentially \"forever,\" until you manually change or delete them. Even the clock remains for several minutes while changing the batteries. If, however, you remove the batteries for a long time, then you will have to reset the clock. This is very easy to do and is the only thing necessary to reset. There are, in fact, two clocks, one of which can be set to your local time, and the other which can be set to any time zone you desire; I have mine set to UTC [GMT]. (When you set the local time, the other time zone is automatically set as well so you only have to set the clock once.)Sony no longer offers a suitable AC Adapter for this radio. However, Radio Shack does. And the Radio Shack AC Adapter (Cat. # 273-025; the appropriate Adapt-A-Plug [free with purchase of the adapter] is Cat. # 273-1705) is not only better than Sony's original, it is smaller and lighter in weight, and less expensive, costing only $12.99. This adapter and plug can be bought at any local Radio Shack store as well as online if you wish. (It is too bad that Amazon does not sell this adapter!)All in all, this radio, especially at Amazon's current price, just cannot be beaten in terms of value for money.It is, in my opinion, the best value in a shortwave receiver currently on the market and, in a world full of often ephemeral electronic \"gizmos,\" one of the few genuine electronic bargains.This is a radio that the owner will never outgrow!================================================================================================================Update: May 16, 2008To improve shortwave reception at home or when traveling, I recommend the Sony AN-LP1 Active Antenna in addition to the Sangean ANT-60 mentioned above. The AN-LP1 is powered by two AA batteries, folds neatly, and fits into a convenient storage bag. While it is for indoor use only (it mounts in a window) or outdoor use only on days on which there is no wind blowing, it is an extremely useful addition to the owner's armamentarium.If you wish to purchase one (it sells for about $115.00 including the shipping) there is an advantage and a disadvantage - and they are both the same! Currently this antenna is being sold ONLY by an eB@y dealer in Japan (just Google \"Buyfromjapan\" and then enter \"AN-LP1\" in his search box) -- but he is absolutely reliable and FAST - you'll have your antenna in less than a week by Express Mail - and he takes the usual major credit cards as well as PayPal.I believe that using an AN-LP1 with an ICF-SW7600GR results in an almost \"perfect\" portable shortwave reception center.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Finest Compact Portable Shortwave Receiver", "unixReviewTime": 1197158400, "reviewTime": "12 9, 2007"}

The radio must be tilted back or you must look at the display from below for the digits to appear. The radio has a multitude of slide switches which are notorious for going open or intermittent. But the main disappointment is the tuning scheme used in the SSB mode. To hit the correct beat note, there is a thumb wheel on the side of the radio that provides a frequency offset. The problem is that the adjustment or rotation range is about plus and minus 5 KHz which is very course. This makes fine adjustment of the LSB or USB pitch very difficult. The range of the thumb wheel should have been plus or minus 1 KHz rather than 5 KHz. All in all, the radio is just awkward to use. You wouldn't want it on your night stand in the dark as the dial light is very dim and useless. Put your money into something with better engineering such as the AOR.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Poor design effort", "unixReviewTime": 1261958400, "reviewTime": "12 28, 2009"}

The great names on the shortwave units of yesteryear are now either slapping their badges on drugstore-discount South Asian made devices, or have stopped making radios altogether. The solid metal, the dials and switches, the detailed engineering, all drifted away and replaced with toy-grade plastic, fewer features, and \"let's see how cheap we can build it\" design. With the exception of one -At first glance, you know right away that the made-in-Japan Sony ICF-SW7600GR is definitely not available at your corner shoppe, much less your local electronics store - the interface consists of 27 buttons, 5 switches, and 3 knobs. There are two clocks and two alarms. There's two output jacks (headphone, line out) right next to the antenna jack. The whip antenna is nearly a full yard in length. Serious, indeed. But as intimidating as it all seems at first, the flowchart-logical layout is very efficient, and anyone who's ever wished their radio had something more than just a Stereo-Mono switch to get a weak signal is accommodated in more ways than one.The seriousness continues when you pick up the 7600GR. Though it's considered a \"coat pocket\" portable, it feels as though it's filled with concrete or perhaps lead shot. If weight is a sign of quality, the 7600GR makes itself unabashedly clear, weighing in at just over 15 iPod Nanos (1 and 1/3 pounds). The positive-click buttons would be at home in a luxury car, the knobs turn smoothly, and switches move confidently into position. Nothing is loose or rattles, everything is buttoned-down and solid. You could say it feels German, but they stopped making portable radios long ago...Yet all the forethought and engineering that went into the exterior is just the prelude to what's on the inside. This would still be a top-tier portable just on it's receiver components alone, but Sony goes a step further, piling on the professional tuning features (one of which, the Synchronous Detector, is not found on portables from any other manufacturer). The 7600GR is a veritable box of solutions to the all-too-common radio reception problems; the \"This weak station is being drowned out by a powerful station\" problem, the \"This station is almost clear except for a weak station in the background\" problem, the \"How can I get rid of this high-pitched interference\" problem, etc. Without getting too technical, this is a very sensitive receiver on its own, and should reception fall short, there's a barrage of trick electronic tuning tools to try out.Of course no radio is perfect, and the 7600GR isn't immune. There's no knob for tuning, which is all done by buttons. The case is too small for high-fidelity sound from the speaker. The backlight is for the display only, not the buttons. But this is all nitpicking in light of pure tuner power; You won't miss the tuning knob when you get that one near-impossible station that no other radio you've tried can get.If you browse around the internet for 7600GR reviews from experienced radio technicians, you'll find that they essentially come in two categories: the first is \"I kept having problem x with radio y, so I just went and got a 7600GR\" and the second is \"I spent more on my radio rig than I did my car, so when I needed a portable I got a 7600GR.\" There aren't any lengthy tirades about technical issues or design failures, just page after page of happy owners, sharing their techniques and experiences. Another Amazon reviewer noted that the Sony is the \"Best shortwave radio under $200\", but this is really selling it short - portable shortwave radios only go up to about $200, and (not counting used units) there aren't any more until you reach the very technical world of tabletop receivers starting at $500. So in reality, *This is the best shortwave radio under $500.*The key to the 7600GR's success is time. The original ICF-SW7600 was introduced way back in 1977, and since then has gone through a miasma of subtle design changes and technical innovations. So as other manufacturers try to find cheaper ways to produce their all-new models, Sony has been slowly honing and refining this single design all along for over 25 years. You can be confident when you hold the 7600GR that it's the time-tested culmination of over a quarter century of engineering and design.

We'll spend hundreds, sometimes thousands of dollars for a lens. Bokeh, the widest possible aperture, reputed clarity of the glass - those things that affect the picture - have to be measured against the impact to our wallets. We'll cough up for AF, IS, even cool stuff like catadioptrics or telephotos so long we look like anteaters carrying them around. Sometimes it gets to the point where we think we *have* to spend a lot of money, lenses are so cool.And yes, I've spent the big money for lenses; I don't like doing it, but sometimes, it seems like to get the features you want, you just have to.This lens taught me something. Maybe you *don't* have to. I'll tell you why.I bought a new camera. An EOS 40D. A great camera for me, does the things I like, and does them well. My first Canon, though, I had no lenses. So I thought long and hard about what lens to get first. I ended up buying a macro lens, about $500 out of pocket by the time it was shipped to me. A great lens, and you bet I got some great macro shots. But it was a *macro* lens, and you know it was only a few days before I was pining to shoot some \"regular\" images. I looked at all manner of lenses, and the choices were just too much. I ended up unable to decide on anything.So... then I saw this. $73? What the heck, let me get this and I'll have something to play with until I can decide among the many others that were seriously vying for my attention.And THEN... then I received the lens. Now I don't feel what it was that attracted me to the more expensive lenses. That's how good this baby is. It's true, it doesn't have as many blades as a higher end lens and so your background blur - bokeh - is a little bit polygonal instead of nice round blurs; but frankly, I consider that to be nit picking in the extreme. Look at the beautiful samples people have uploaded here, actual results, and you can see that it will do a great job of isolating foreground objects. The bokeh is fine unless you're in some kind of pro competition or you are so finicky about your photos you sit in front of your prints all night, twisting your hands like someone who's had too much coffee.Plus, this thing is really, really sharp. Give it the best chance - lots of light, tripod mount, fast shutter speed - and you'll be rewarded with pixel level detail, or at least as much as the optical low pass filter in your camera lets through to your sensor if you're shooting digital. I was *astonished* at the clarity, the EOS 40D's 10 mp sensor would surely find any glass problems, but... nothing. It makes perfect pictures. The AF works precisely, so that using center point only on my 40D, I was able to resolve exact details on many subjects using nothing but the AF. This is *not* typical behavior for an inexpensive lens.Speed: It's pretty quick, all right, especially if you're willing to sacrifice some depth of field. Canon's got an f/1.2 in the L series for about 20 times the price if this really isn't quick enough. Though I suspect that most of you, like me, look at lenses priced well above $1000 and quickly find other things we want to buy instead. Like a whole new camera! With this lens, you can literally shoot decent space photos on a high-megapixel camera just by setting the lens to wide open aperture, laying your camera on its back, and using a good fast ISO setting. There's a good example of this in the gallery. I tried it for myself, and it worked great (by the way, see if you can find a moment to rate that photo up... it's a terrific example of what the lens can do!) Frankly, that's something only a really fast lens can pull off, at least, in my experience - because if you keep the shutter open too long, you'll have star trails instead of points.Features: It's a basic lens. It just works. Which is just what we want, of course. But that's not to say it doesn't bring some features to the table.It's good from about one and a half feet out to infinity; it's autofocus, but you can't touch the focus ring while it is driving it - it isn't a full time manual focus design. There's a switch for manual / AF mode in the usual place. One thing I appreciated was the red alignment dot being a physical nub instead of just being silk-screened on (or inside!) the lens - I change lenses around often, and I really eyeball those dots a lot to save wear and tear on the camera. You get both the lens covers you need, one for the business end and one for the camera end (for when it isn't mounted on the camera.) It uses 52 mm filters, and the threading is well machined, I had no trouble at all attaching and removing filters. It takes the ES-62 hood, which is not included. The lens system itself is five groups of six elements for f/1.8 - they didn't just throw it together.Now, as to build. Yes, the barrel is plastic. Plastic is not a dirty word, though, really - it can be quite durable, with the right plastic in the right application.The lens feels fine, not \"cheap\" at all. I mean this in the sense that the lens fits the camera well, and there are no funny noises or other warning signs of less than sufficient design.It *is* plastic, and one thing about that is that the lens is very light weight for what it does, and that makes longer shooting sessions more pleasant. I can tell you that my physically much larger macro lens tires me out in just a few minutes; this lens doesn't do that, it's almost like it weighs nothing - it's only 4.6 ounces, all of it physically close to the camera so it doesn't exert much leverage on your wrists.Here's an issue you can, and should, sink your teeth into: When focusing, the lens physically extends, and that is a difference between a more expensive lens and this one that can really matter. This is because it affects how you can use the lens. It is something you should, no, you *must*, keep in mind when using this lens. I'll explain.Actually, I would speculate that of the people who managed to destroy this lens in short order, I bet at least some of them physically had the business end of the lens resting on something, or were holding onto the focusing ring when the AF system tried to drive the lens to a new physical configuration, and poof - the gear train, or the motor, or both, went nipples north.You just can't do that - not with *any* lens that extends physically. Don't touch, or rest, the focus ring on this lens in AF mode, EVER! If you watch out for that one issue when you use it, just keep the lens free in the air and your fingers off the ring, I bet the lens will last years.Why so confident? Simple: Based on the incredible track record Canon has for its camera and lens product lines, I think we can very safely say that Canon knows precisely what they are doing, generally speaking. They're not fools, I think we can all agree.With that in mind, simply consider that Canon has placed a full one year warranty on the lens. Frankly, I don't believe they would do that if it was truly going to fall apart in a few months when used properly, as some of the less positive reviews here have said. Treat it right, it'll almost certainly treat you right. This is *Canon*, people, not the Wang Chung Junque Manufacturing Co. operating out of a cave somewhere.In the end, even if mine did break, I'd replace it in a heartbeat. It is a truly great lens for the money. Highly recommended.*** I've added an image to the image gallery that is a CLIP of a small portion of an image shot of the night sky. In it, you can clearly see the great nebula in Andromeda. I've identified the individual stars for you, and you can see the entire image by checking my flickr account (fyngyrz).

Hacker", "helpful": [27, 30], "reviewText": "This review is lengthy, detailed, and honest, but it reflects my personal experience which will likely differ greatly from your own, so keep that in mind. This review is geared towards budget minded people (I am a university student after all) with 1.6x crop-sensor cameras, e.g. Rebel, XT, 20D, 30D, etc. who probably started out with the kit lens and now have outgrown it.This is an optically excellent lens at a truly bargain price. Particularly if you are going to this straight from the kit lens, you will be amazed and even shocked at the quality of the images this lens can produce compared to the kit lens.Low-light performance is excellent, with the large aperture (still incredibly sharp wide open) allowing wonderful low light flash-free photography which will greatly impress you, your friends, and your family after you photograph people candidly at your next gathering.This brings me to the focal length limitation. For what I just described, candid low-light photography at a party or other gathering, as well as candid shots of children and pets, this lens excels because on a 1.6 crop camera (such as the Digital Rebel series, which I imagine most people who buy this lens have) this equals approximately an 85mm lens in 35mm film camera terms. This is a classic portrait focal length, and so naturally it is perfect for candid portraits (as well as posed ones, of course) because it lets you get pretty close to people without sticking the camera in their face, as well as providing pleasing out of focus backgrounds with very sharp subjects. Canon also makes an 85mm f/1.8 lens which people who own the more expensive full-frame cameras love for the same reasons those of us with the 1.6 cameras love this one, because the focal length and large aperture are perfect for the sort of photography I've just described.It's not that it has no use besides that, though; I've taken many landscape and cityscape photos with this lens that are wonderful. But usually, I feel very closed in by the long focal length. If you're a long distance away from your subject, this lens can often be great for landscape and nature photography, but eventually you'll be longing for a wider field of view and will at least be tempted to go back to the kit lens for many shots, and for some you will absolutely need it.And this is its biggest problem, which is the flip side of this being a great lens for low-light social gatherings - even if you only use this lens for low light situations, you will feel like you need a wider field of view at least half of the time. To get a group shot of four or five people with this lens in a small house, I literally had to shoot from across the next room through the door, and that still wasn't quite wide enough. My only other option was to use the kit lens, which with its f/3.5 maximum at the widest focal length is just not usable for most low-light situations without a tripod or flash, so I had no choice.To reiterate, it is very likely that if you aren't already spending a lot of money on your camera and lens collection, you will really feel the limitation of not having a wide enough field of view for a lot of your photography. Depending on your style and what you mainly shoot, you could easily get very frustrated with this lens despite its strengths.The other thing that is likely if you're upgrading to this from the kit lens is that you will get addicted to the insane increase in picture quality and low-light usability and will not ever want to use the kit lens again, which means you'll need another higher quality lens that gives you a wider field of view. I used this lens more or less exclusively for about three months, became frustrated at not having a wider field of view, and ended up buying the $350 Sigma 30mm f/1.4 for its \"normal\" ~50mm equivalent on my 1.6 crop camera, and for its large aperture. That lens is great, by the way, and I wholly recommend it instead of this 50mm lens if you've got the money. You do lose the advantages of the 50mm's long reach for portrait situations, but in general you can make up for this by getting closer to the subject, which admittedly is not always possible. Solution? Get both ;)Ultimate advice? If you've only got the kit lens and maybe a cheap telephoto zoom and you really don't want to or simply can't spend money on more expensive lenses in the near future, don't get this lens yet. Save your money up for a more versatile (and still optically excellent) lens in the $300-400 range, namely the \"standard digital zooms\" offered by Sigma, Tamron, and Tokina in that price range. I am currently saving up for one of these (probably the Sigma 17-70, the least expensive of them, since the advantages of the others are covered by the 30mm and 50mm lenses).If you crave the low-light performance (which was what attracted me), and you really don't feel like you can spend $300 or more for something like the Sigma 30mm f/1.4, then go for it, but don't say I didn't warn you. You'll be craving more expensive lenses in no time.Another disadvantage that you won't notice too much unless/until you have more expensive lenses is the build quality. In terms of durability I'd say this lens is great and it will hold up to normal abuse, but it definitely feels like a plastic toy, the manual focus ring is only marginally better than the one on the kit lens (which is a joke), and if you care about this sort of thing, it looks a little awkward on the camera (I have the Rebel XT). It is the same size as the 50mm lens for my 1978 Canon A1, but since the body styling on these new cameras is so different from the classic camera body style this size and shape looks a little silly. It's purely a cosmetic concern, but don't be surprised if you feel a little self-conscious about using it in public (this won't stop you from using it, of course, because you'll know that the silly look of the lens has no bearing on the outstanding results you get).Finally, the autofocus motor is a little noisy, but if you're used to the kit lens you won't mind it because it's only slightly louder than that (just wait until you're spoiled by the silent and super fast ultrasonic motors on the more expensive lenses, though...) The focus accuracy is excellent, even in low light, but there's no avoiding that it will occasionally have to hunt for focus in very low light and while this is extremely annoying, there's really not much you can do about it even with the more expensive lenses and cameras.Overall - it is hard not to recommend this lens, but only if you get it knowing its limitations ahead of time and you are ok with it, and accept that it will probably make you want more expensive lenses to go along with it.Again - for the things it is best for (portraits and candids, kids, etc., though of course you can do a lot of creative things with it), you can't do better than this lens, especially on a budget (but, this lens compares extremely well with the much more expensive similar lenses!) What it absolutely is not, though, is a \"walk-around\", general all-purpose lens that you can leave on your camera most of the time like in the film days when most people just had the 50mm f/1.8 lens that came with their camera and never took it off.

My only issue with this lens is that the Manual / AF switch was a bit difficult to slide.

It's so cheap.  It's fast and sharp.Eventually, every photographer needs a fixed lens at somewhere around this focal range.  I favor zooms for telephoto: it's hard to quickly shuffle on foot between a 70mm and 300mm focal range.  I also like zooms for wide angle: you can grab a big landscape or group shot, then a person in close-up, all of which makes a wide-angle zoom a good \"walkaround\" lens, especially for travelers.  The \"middle range\" between, say, 35mm and 100mm is portrait-range, and a great opportunity for the extra precision and handiness of a prime lens.Prime lenses usually generate better images at every price point, and the EF 50mm f/1.8 II is no exception.  In fact, on a ratio of image quality to price, this lens may be unmatched.  Images are sharp and have nice contrast and color.  At faster speed, indoor shots without flash are easily possible at reasonable lighting levels.  This is crucial for those of us without high-end flashes and who rightly abhor built-in flashes, or flashes in general.  The speed (and, again, the clarity) of this lens makes it an obscene bargain.  See the peachfuzz on your baby's cheek?  Get it; no flash.  It's also disposable: you can take greater risks because replacement costs are relatively low.Buy this, at least as a holdover, until you get L-series glass for your portrait range prime lens.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Until the Real Thing Comes Along", "unixReviewTime": 1151798400, "reviewTime": "07 2, 2006"}

In natural light shots you bet!!I did some tripod mounted tests at different F stops and it's sharper at F1.8 then the kit lens is at any setting at any focal length.  However!!  You do not want to use flash with this lens.  I know I know you buy this lens to take natural light photography. But I flipped up the flash on my Rebel Xti to add light when my daughter wanted the lights out to blow out the candles on her birthday cake. The results where terrible!!  There was glare on all reflective materials and highlight over exposure.  Plus when trying to  focus on moving subjects in candle light you had better be ready to switch to manual focus.I found out that this lens is an old design and does not support E-TTL II flash photography and does not have the coatings the newer designed for digital photography anti-glare coatings or distance flash distance measurement system. What does all that mean for the person who bought this for natural light photography?  Nothing, it doesn't detract at all just know that the flash photography will not be anywhere near as good as that of the kit lens or any of the newer lens.Now, on to the good, this lens is great at natural light portrait photography on the cropped 1.6 Digital Rebel Body!!! On this camera it's now a 80mm lens, perfect for Portrait, with very nice Bokeh and good contrast.  Great for low light when you have to get a shot like this with no flash.On the other hand, it's not much good for anything else.  This field of view is too narrow with a cropped sensor for getting the entire scene and if you want their entire body you really have to back up.  It's also too narrow for scenic shots where you want people in the foreground and great wide scenic shots of places like the Grand Canyon where you would need something like 17 - 24mm.  It's also too short to be a telephoto lens.  Why do I mention this?  Because you will surly want a good zoom lens in addition to this lens Do NOT buy this as your only lens.  Buy it as a backup to a good zoom for when you need low light great Portrait or both.  Also know that you will be switching between the two during a shoot to get good portrait and wider angle shots.  In fact if you find yourself in a situation where you need to be versatile do NOT put this lens on your camera, it is not very versatile.  What do I mean by versatile?  Situations where you need to change angle of view or switch from natural to flash photography quickly.  Or shots where there is a lot of movement causing you to refocus your shot quickly.Bottom Line:  If you are cash strapped and want a great natural light Portrait lens to go with your Canon Digital Rebel then go with this lens.  If you have a little more money then you should go for the F/1.4 50mm lens which focuses faster has better build quality etc. and does the same job just better.If you can only afford just one do it all lens in this price range do NOT get this lens, get the 18-55mm kit lens  It's not as sharp in natural light but is all around a much more versatile lens and produces much better  flash photos.If you can afford $200 buy this 50mm F/1.8 lens and the 18-55 kit lens and use them together as a team.In closing over all I am pleased with the F/1.8 50MM lens when using it as a natural light portrait lens, but it's not as versatile as I thought it would be and I wonder if I should have saved up my money and waited to get the 50MM  F/1.4  lens which is a much better lens over all even if it does cost more then 3 time as much.  Now however I am hearing that the F/1.4 is having reliability problems with the auto focus and manual focus.  When shooting a wedding I can not use a lens I can not rely on.  I can rely on the F/1.8 to see me through and even afford a backup just in case I drop it again.3-28-2008 UpdateI now own the expensive and heavy Canon 85mm F/1.2 L II and Canon 135mm F/2 L lens for portraits and of course they blow this poor 50mm away.  But I still have a soft spot in my heart for this lens and for those on a budget or for those who are taking this lens into areas where you would not want to take an expensive lens I still heartily recommend the Canon 50mm F/1.8 II lens for the price it takes fantastic photos!Filter Update 3/28/2008After much searching I found the perfect filter. The Hoya Multi Coat HMC Pro1 Protection filter is not supposed to filter the shot just protect the front lens element. I was very worried that it would affect the shot after having tried some other premium filters like the B+W UV which caused the photos to be softer and duller. However, after some tests I found that in some weird way the Hoya Multi Coat HMC Pro1 actually makes the photos seem to have just a little more contrast and be a little sharper then without. I thought I had gotten the test shots backwards and had to retest with a little sign in the photo saying with and without filter in place just to make sure. Really amazing!!! I'm sold!7-4-2008 Update:My love of this lens continues.  Not long ago I took another short motorcycle ride with some friends and didn't want to risk my more expensive lens and camera.  So, I took my Canon Rebel XTi and 50mm F/1.8 lens.  I had forgotten just how great this little lens is.  You can take nice portraits with decent bokeh (some shots it's really good, but points of light show the 5 aperture blades producing 5 sided points of light).  You can vary the shot with F/1.8 giving you a creamy white super soft effect for the women and F/2.5 giving you less Bokeh but the sharpness you need for detail shots and male portraits.  The big plus for me as well is the weight. This is a combo you can carry all day long without killing your back and arms.At this low price how can you NOT own this lens?01-03-2009 Canon 5D Mark II Update:This lens which was pretty decent on the 40D and Rebel XTi comes completely apart on the 5D Mark II. No surprise since it's only $89. I guess the surprise was how well it works on a Canon 40D and Rebel XTi.If you have a cropped sensor camera I still recommend for the reasons listed in my review.

The EF 50mm f/1.8 lens is often described as a \"must have\" lens for new photographers, so I gave it a shot.  I must say, I've been very pleased.Pros:f/1.8 Aperature:This lens is \"fast\" in that it has a very wide maximum aperature (f/1.8), meaning it lets through more light and can thus take photos with a faster shutter speed than a \"slower\" lens.  A wide aperature also allows for very shallow depth-of-field (and thus a lot of background blur).Because of the wide aperature, the lens is useful both for lower-light conditions--allowing you to still shoot at fast enough shutter speeds to permit handholding and often without having to add a flash--and for portraiture in well-lighted conditions, in which the background will be blurred.Cost:How many lenses of reasonable quality can you find for under $100?Cons:Focal Length on Digital SLRs:For the digital SLR user, unless you're using a full-frame camera, the crop factor of the APS-C sized sensor will make this lens more in the range of 80mm and thus a medium telephoto rather than the \"normal view\" 50mm that many film shooters are expecting--so keep that in mind.Autofocus:The autofocus is not Canon's USM system and is thus a bit slow and noisy, and it requires the use of a small switch to change over to manual focus (no full-time manual focus).  Sometimes, the lens seems to \"stick\" in manual focus after being switched there and then back to auto, requiring a dismounting and remounting of the lens to get it working right again.Minimum Focusing Length:This is not a macro lens and thus cannot focus at extremely close range, although I've successfully used it as such with the \"poor man's macro\" screw-on magnifying lenses.  The loss of quality in doing so has not been a problem for me, anyway.Build Quality:Make no mistake--the lens' cheap price is reflected somewhat in its build quality, although the optics themselves seem to be fairly good.  The lens may feel \"cheap,\" and probably would break if dropped, but at the price, one could easily afford to replace it.Summary:Overall, I'm quite pleased with this lens and am glad to have purchased it.

This lens was highly recommended.  When I received lens I took a few test shots and discovered the lens not as sharp as I had expected based on the comments in the evaluations.  The kit lens on my Canon T2i was much sharper.Several days after lens arrived I attended the event.

I removed the lens, wiped off the contacts, assembled camera and lens and resumed shooting.  Almost immediately another notice and another cleaning.

My theory now is that Canon doesn't put this baby as their kit lens because many people would decide that they DONT NEED ANOTHER ONE! And many of them would be right!Like others, I bought the Rebel XT and the 28-135 IS lens. The 28-135 is heavy and priced like a gold brick. I guess it does OK, and I do keep it mounted most of the time.And like others, I stumbled on this lens somehow, read the raving reviews, and for the price figured, \"What the heck?\"This lens in tack sharp. It shows the fire in the colors you photograph. The wide aperture means candles can be excellent lights for portraits. Its narrow field is great.There are pitfalls though. I snapped a pic of my face at arm's length using autofocus a while back and (1) the focus locked on the tip of my nose and my face was already blurring (2) the lens was so sharp that I saw blackheads clearly on my nose tip I can't really see in the mirror (doh!). I've read that dSLR images are slightly soft to aid in later editing. I can only imagine what it would do on a film camera.Yesterday while camping I slapped this lens on. Unlike the 28-135, this one is light enough that I didnt notice I was carrying a camera everywhere. At night I put the lens on the top of the car pointed at the sky, set the shutter for 15 secs, and hit the button. Much to my amazement, the lens not only showed hundreds of stars that were invisible to my eyes, but it also found a galaxy. That pic is on the customer image section of this page. You can see what I saw, but the smaller size doesnt do the lens justice.One quirk of Amazon is that this page keeps alternating pictures of lenses. This lens does not have the distance focus scales on the outside of it.Zoom is nice for many things. But where zoom isnt necessary, performance is very, very nice. Performance at $70 is almost too good to be true.Let me close by repeating what has been said elsewhere and will continue to be said here....IF YOU OWN A SLR, STOP NOW AND GET THIS LENS!UPDATE 12/06 I have owned this lens for about a year now. Over that time I have immersed myself in photography, workshops, books, tests, etc. I have since upgraded to the 30D and a couple of L lenses, and now have a portfolio strong enough that I am now getting dollar signs thrown at me that I didnt even see coming. I say all this to give you some perspective on what I will write afterward.Now that Ive really learned the difference, I can agree with others that it is a tad soft wide open, but that is to be expected. I read a lens test recently that put the 1.8 against Canons heavweight L glass, and, not surprisingly, the L beat out the $70 plastic wonder in most categories. What might surprise you, however, is that when the lens was tested at F 8 it BEAT THE L GLASS in sharpness! As one that has felt the pain of trading large sums of money for L glass, I appreciate affordable quality...not something anyone can plan on seeing much of in photography.My 28-135 has since joined my kit lens in the garage. The 1.8 is still in my case with my newer 30D.With some experience under my belt I now would make the following recommendation. Right now, as you read this,  you may have an idea if you've been bitten by the photog bug. You may know that this beast is going to morph into something more than a simple pasttime. If you look inside the depths of your aspirations and you know that you are going to be a serious amateur, bite the bullet and get the 50mm 1.4. Trust me on this one. Eventually you'll end up getting it anyway, so just apply the $70 to the 1.4 now.If you're just exploring different areas of SLR photography, you cant go wrong with this lens. Case in point- as of this writing the baby in pink in the customer images section of this lens is one of the top-ten rated images of all pics uploaded on Amazon! This lens will allow you to dazzle friends and relatives used to snapshots from point & shoots. It will be the start of what you upgraded to a DSLR for in the first place.

Before I'd just take mindless pictures - stand in one place and shoot away.

These two items are more than likely what combine to give some users soft shots, particularly at the long end of the zoom. Using a lens of 400mm is a skill. You need the same basic techniques as a good rifle shooter: controlled breathing, squeezing the shutter as opposed to mashing it down and a good, steady stance. You also need, even with IS, to keep shutter speeds up. Remember, at 400mm on a 1.6x camera, you're shooting with a 640mm equivalent lens. With the fl/shutter ratio of 1:1, you should keep shutter speeds up to 1/640. Even with IS on, you need to maintain a decent shutter speed if you want sharp shots. Use a gimbel head on your tripod and you'll really see this big guy shine.There's talk of copy-to-copy IQ issues, and as I mentioned above, I think they are linked to technique instead of variations of the lens - though I won't rule that out. There's also talk of the push-pull mechanism sucking dust. While air has to go in and out, it's a sealed lens and I think this is another widely circulated myth. Some dust is going to be present, but I don't think it's a \"dust trombone\" as some have suggested.Don't let this be your only source of info on this fine lens.

You can also add the 1.4X TC for a 896mm upper limit or the 2X TC for an amazing 1280mm.  Of course this comes at a price, and I'm not just talking money.  You will have to use a tripod, cable release, and mirror lockup a lot of the time when using such long focal lengths.  Plus this thing is very heavy and very large and people will take notice.  So if stealth photography is your goal, go with something like the 70-300 DO.That being said, this is an amazing lens, admittedly a little slow near the long end, but to get down to f/4 would have most likely doubled or tripled the price and weight, so it seems like an acceptable trade-off.If you want sharp pictures, an amazing zoom range, and a good workout, but don't mind being the center of attention, this is the lens for you.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A Workout, but Well Worth it", "unixReviewTime": 1146182400, "reviewTime": "04 28, 2006"}

This lens is that good.I bought this lens to photograph birds primarily.  To say I've been extremely happy would be an understatement.  The IS component of this lens will astound you.  I've also used this lens handheld at air shows as well and quite frankly, when I get home to look at my photos I'm nothing short of astonished at how well image stabilization works.  Note, however, that most of my work is done on a tripod to photograph our beautiful feathered friends.  If you'd like to see  what I'm talking about you can visit my site in my profile or just Google \"Christopher Tippins\" and see for yourself how the lens performs.  All of my recent bird photography and air show photography has been shot exclusively with this lens (see \"New Photos\").Also note that you will further be impressed to the nines when you are shooting at the short end of the focal length of this lens (about 6 or 7 feet, give or take).  I've shot dragon flies, flowers and various other subjects and the detail is nothing less than spectacular.  You will literally be able to count hairs on the back of insects/dragon flies, etc.I've used it on two bodies - the Canon 60d and a recently acquired Canon 7d.  It performs superbly on both as is to be expected.Recently I was doing some shooting at a zoo and pushed the ISO to 1000 on the 7d to get some shots in low light at  1/15 of a second and got some tack sharp images (yes, I've had to run those shots through some noise reduction filters, however).  I couldn't believe it.Note that Canon (and many people) recommend shooting with IS turned OFF on a tripod.  While your mileage may vary, I find wind at the 400mm end of this lens to be a factor and leaving IS turned on helps considerably.Image quality with this lens wide open is also impressive.Also take note of this:  I have a bud who shoots with this lens as well as a Canon 400 prime and I'll be damned if I (we) can see any difference in the quality of the shots.  I also recently purchased the Canon 1.4 telephoto extender (older type II) and I'm equally impressed with how well they work together as well, but that's another review.Note that I am of the type of person who is a very harsh (but fair) critic of products in general.If you're the same, you will NOT be disappointed in this lens.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Magnificence Defined", "unixReviewTime": 1325808000, "reviewTime": "01 6, 2012"}

This is your best bet!!If you need 300mm or 400mm and are on a budget, buy it!If you need a Zoo or air show lens this is it, buy it!You won't be disappointed!!4-27-2009 I just got back from photographing the World Premiere of X-Men Origins: Wolverine and once again the 100-400 IS L lens was awesome.  I ended up mainly using two lenses the Canon 24-70 F/2.8 L zoom and Canon 100-400 IS L zoom lens with most photos taken with the 100-400.  When you have only one chance to get Hugh Jackman  riding by on his Harley you want to make sure you have reliable quick focusing equipment.  Plus a lot of times you just can't get any closer to the action like at a World Movie Premiere, it's times like that when you absolutly need a zoom and the 100-400 IS L is one of the best!  [...]01-03-09 Canon 5D Mark II Update:Canon 100-400 F/4.5 - F/5.6 IS L lens. This is the second most used lens in my 5D Mark II arsenal. This lens was my biggest surprise and is not only tied for second place with the Canon 135mm F/2 for sharpness but is amazingly sharp wide open. It's a monster of clarity at F/7.1 like it never was on my Canon 40D. It also becomes useable on the 5D Mark II in wider shot situations where on the 40D it was only usable as a longer lens. Sporting the longest zoom range of any Canon zoom this lens has to be without doubt the finest Zoo lens ever made. You can frame almost any animal in almost any exhibit perfectly. This is also my lens of choice for taking photos of people at events and aircraft at air shows with the 5D Mark II and is the King of versatility on a full-framed sensor camera. This is my sharpest and clearest zoom lens by a long shot (no pun intended. It's as close to the you are there feeling of the 85mm F/1.2 lI lens as any zoom lens I have.After an extensive battery of tests both hand held and tripod mounted I have come to the following shocking conclusions.The Canon 100-400 L zoom is almost as sharp at F/8 as my Canon 85mm  F/1.2 at F4 and that's saying something!!!Slightly sharper at F/8 as my Canon 70-200 F/2.8 and that's saying something to!!!I may have a very sharp copy and I hear there are soft copies out there.  Make sure and buy yours here at Amazon.com where you can return the lens if its not as sharp as you thought.Pros:Super Sharp!Very versatile!Great ContrastGood bang for the buck100-400mm SWEET!This is the perfect Zoo lensThis is the perfect Air Show Zoo lensThis is the perfect Renaissance Festival lensAttracts a lot of attention, you will be asked if you are a proImage stabilizer lets you get away with crazy like shutter speedsSweet Bokeh at subject filling close range and at all ranges on full frame sensor cameraRaw photos respond well to sharpening and contrast / colors in Canon Digital Photo professionalCons:Can be heavy for the uninitiated!Does draw dust into your camera when zoomed!Old style image stabilizer must turn off on tripodZoom locking ring is attached to the manual focus ring.No weather proofing, a strange thing for an out door lensAttracts a lot of attention, you will be asked if you are a proPulls dust into lens around the zoom ring when zooming in and outSlow auto focus compared to other L lens, slower then all of them except my Canon 85mm F/1.2 L IIStrange black hole if you take a photo when jerking the lens to track a birdLens sometimes seems to slow cameras response when taking a photoOn cropped sensor cameras only strange variable looking Bokeh at some distances especially when stopped down and in sunlight with contrasting lines like branches.  Wonder bokeh no full frame camera (5D Mark II)I gave it only 4 Stars because of the crazy way the zoom friction and manual focus rings are together and lack of weather sealing and variable Bokeh.  It takes a dedicated photographer familiar with the lens to get consistent because of the variable Bokeh. Separate the manual focus and zoom friction rings, give it weather sealing, updated IS and great Bokeh at all settings and ranges and I would have given it 5 stars!Introduction:Longer range and versatility that's what I needed for my Canon 40D.  What good is a prime if you don't get the shot at all?  I mean I love my Canon 135mm F/2 it has the best Bokeh in the world along with my 85mm F/1.2 but it's a little short for birding even on a 40D and after renting a Canon EF 500mm f/4L IS you know what the meaning of heavy (8.5 pounds) and specialized mean.Plus there's nothing like having a zoom, take time to change out that lens during a renaissance festival and you just may miss a once in a lifetime shot.My 70-200 F/2.8 L is a great lens but the zoom range is way too short at times like these.  I want something with much more zoom capability.I wanted something I could take to the zoo and gets shots both near and far and the same at air shows and the renaissance festival and maybe even a football or soccer game or rodeo and all without a time consuming dust introducing lens change.  At the festival you can go from a knight and damsel group portrait shot to a close up of a bird of prey flying by in a second and without changing lens.  At an air show you can be shooting the crowd waiting in line to board a C5 Galaxy cargo plane and in the same minute swing up and get an F-16 cockpit shot as it roars by.  On a cropped camera you are at 640mm and into serious birding territory on a full framed hey you still have 100-400.First shots:OK, I must have gotten a really good sample because after sharpening  the Raw files in Canon Digital Photo Professional (DPP) this lens is sharp at all zooms and very sharp indeed stopped down to 7.1 between 300 and 375mm.  No complaints there that's for sure!! It's very close to my Canon 70-200mm F/2.8 in it's sweet spot.Zoos:WOW!!!  I visited the Phoenix Zoo this last Saturday with my Canon 40D and this new Canon 100-400 IS L zoom and all I can think of is wow!!  Where have you been all of my life?  With a zoom range of 160 to 640mm when mounted on my Canon 40D you can't go wrong.  And with the image stabilizer IS you can literaly stick this camera in auto ISO and walk through the entire zoo with just one lens and get great closeup shots of everything.  Need a portrait of that Tiger while he's walking the back wall as far away as he can get?  No problem, zoom out to 400mm which equals 640mm, here kitty kitty kitty.  And how about the Flamingo's right up next to the fence and you want the whole group, just zoom back to 100mm and bingo!I wonder why I hadn't purchased this lens from the start.  No dust educing, time eating lens changes required, just go through every exhibit with the one lens picking off animals one by one or in groups.  It's like shooting fish in a barrel, yeee haaaa!!!Notes:Seems sharpest at 375mm and F/7.1 and F/8Variable Bokeh, can be the best or worst depending on use (see Bokeh below)Air (and dust) seems to enter and exit around zoom ring as you zoom (NOT into and out of the camera sensor as some would have you believe).Review:This lens takes some getting used to, it's different: longer, more complicated, push pull zoom and IS make it a little more complicated then the other lenses I have.The first few shots I took with it were rather disappointing but then I started finding the groove for this long-range photographic weapon and when used in that scope you can score some really fantastic jaw dropping photos.Overall my Canon 70-200 F/2.8 seems to make a slightly more pleasing photo at times and at other times the 100-400 does.  The 70-200 as more consistently pleasing Bokeh.  But the 100-400 200mm longer.  The physical size when the 100-400 is at 100mm is very close indeed and the weight feels close to the same in the hand with the 70-200 feeling slightly lighter.The strange thing I find too is the zoom locking ring and manual focus ring are attached to each other and change position as you zoom in and out.  This makes for a little confusion when reaching for it at first as you never know where it is when quickly reaching for it while keeping your eyes in the viewfinder.  That and if it's tight at all you have to take both hands to release the tension and move the zoom where you want.The Groove:Make sure you have the IS in the ON positionShoot with plenty of light and hold her steadyShoot between 300mm and 375mm at F/7.1 or F/8Make sure focus limiter switch is in the correct positionShoot in Raw and process in Digital Photo Professional (DPP)Don't be afraid to push the sharpness and color way up in DPP as neededPractice Practice Practice  if you are shooting digital then you can practice plenty.Image Stabilizer (IS):I have taken HAND HELD SHOTS at 1/10s and 1/6s even zoomed out to 400mm of the neighbors house and car down the street and they came out so well you can read the license plate!  I set my 40D to 3200 ISO and wide open aperture then simply propped my elbows on top of the trash can and took some night shots to see what this lens could do. I couldn't do it every shot only about 1 out of 5 to get my breathing and the timing of the shot right but the fact that I could pull these shots off at all is incredible!!!To get consistent shots I in better lighting conditions I have found with my elbows propped I can consistently pull off 1/30 second at 400mm which works out to 640mm on a 40D!  With un-propped arms I could pull of 1/60 second at 400mm.  This alone should be a good reason to buy this lens.Bokeh:On full frame cameras like the Canon 5D Mark II the Bokeh is great.  At close range it's almost as good as any lens I have.  Well except for maybe the Canon 85mm F/1.2 II L.  But over all it's great.But, if you are using this lens on a cropped sensor then be sure to read the next paragraph.How could one lens have such fantastic Bokeh in one shot and such strange horrible Bokeh in the next?  Up close with frame filling subjects near wide open aperture the Bokeh is a dream, but shoot at further distances with a cropped sensor camera like a Rebel or Canon 40D/50D etc with branches as a background stopped down so you can see some detail there are weird lines around each item.  Shooting aircraft or birds in flight this is no problem as the background is just sky, but distant birds in trees with some leaves and limbs out of focus and the photos can look very strange.Lens Vignetting (Light Fall-off)Light fall off in the corner of your photos or vignetting is no longer a problem for any Canon lens on the newer Canon Digital Cameras like the Canon Rebel XTi, XSi, 40D/50D, 5D Mark II as the Vignetting can be corrected automatically in-camera and with Raw photos in Digital Photo Professional (DPP).  You can even adjust the amount of correction to your photos as needed with Raw photos in DPP, sweet!!!In flight tips:Shooting in-flight birds and planes with this lens then follow these tips.Shoot in bright lightSet minimum focus switch to 6.5 metersTurn Off IS if you have enough light, the auto focus seems a little faster without itSet Auto Focus Mode to AI Servo and Drive mode to maximum frames per secondSet exposure compensation to +2/3 stop especially for darker birds or bird will be underexposedMake sure shutter speed will be at least 1/500s or faster set aperture and or ISO as needed I usually end up on Auto ISO on my 40DPre-focus on something similar to the distance of the target bird or planePull zoom back to 100mm to ease acquirement of target bird then zoom as needed towards 400mm while trackingStart shooting as soon as a decent focus and composition of the bird is acquired (DON'T wait for the perfect composition)If needed try looking over the top of the camera and down the top of the lens barrel and try to acquire the bird first then look through the lens.Once acquired hold down the shutter and keep firing off photos as you never know which shot will be a keeper.Push / Pull ZoomThis is a love / hate affair because I love the way I can quickly zoom from 100  - 400mm very rapidly, but...The friction ring to adjust the tension of zooming is attached to the manual focus ring.  This means you can't simply reach forward and grasp the friction ring and adjust it with one hand.  No you must hold the lens with two hands one holding the focus ring and the other the friction ring and then adjust.The friction ring and manual focus rings both move back and forth with the front part of the lens when you zoom.  What this means is when you are in the heat of battle you can't always reach forward by feel and do a manual focus as the distance out on the zoom where the focus ring is located is highly variable.I don't know if it's possible but if it were I would have Canon redesign the zoom ring and the focus ring separate.  This would allow me to reach up and adjust the friction ring by touch without having to hold the manual focus ring to keep both from just turning.  And to adjust the manual focus without tightening up or loosing the friction ring.Anyway the whole process takes a little while to get used to especially for those of use coming from say a 70-200 F/2.8 zoom where I can always just adjust the zoom of the lens a little with no thought and without taking my eyes off the subject from the viewfinder.Uses:Any outdoor photography where you need a wide focal range in a really short amount of time and can't always get really close to your subject but need a close up of it.  Zoo's, Air Shows, Renaissance Festivals, Rodeos, Football, Baseball, Soccer I can think of lot's of tests in the coming weeks for this lens and I intend to hit every one of them.Verdict:If you need a zoom with more reach then your 70-200 then this is your best option.  Try it and you just might like it.Updates:As usual I will be coming back to this post and giving updates on my use of this lens.  I have Canon a 5D Mark II on order and will update with how this lens works on a full frame body.  Should be a whole another world.11-04-2008 Update:I have found that by taking the tripod mount off the lens is much more comfortable to hold and you can get to the zoom friction lock ring and the manual focus ring much easier.  The IS on this lens makes a tripod an option not mandatory and when out photographing wild life hand holding is much easier.11-05-2008 Update:I put all my longer lenses up against the Canon 100-400 in a battery of tests both hand held and tripod mounted and was amazed at the results.  At F/8 where it's sharpest Zoomed to 135mm and 200mm it's as sharp as my Canon 135mm F/2 prime and my Canon 70-200 F/2.8 zoom.  And it has better contrast then the 135mm F/2.  Both the 135mm and 70-200 have better Bokeh though but I was surprised how useful the 100-400 with IS can be in low light as long as the subject is motionless.  I have found with practice and bracing I can consistently get good sharp photos at 400mm at 1/30 second and have scored a few shots as slow as 1/6 second by bracing both elbows putting the camera on high speed and shooting 6 shot bursts.  One or two of the middle shots are always sharp.  Simply amazing!!  So if anyone is telling you this lens is worthless on a darker day or at sunrise or sunset they just don't know this lens.  I have found even getting pretty sloppy you can get consistent shots at 400mm at 1/200 second.  Next earl morning shoot at the bird sanctuary this 100-400 is the lens I am bringing.11-07-2008 Update:I have found that you can actually rotate the tripod mount up 180 degrees so that it is facing upward and out of your way but still have it on the lens.  Could be handy if you want to have the mount with you but not in the way when using the lens.11-12-2008 Update:The more I use this lens and get used to it the more I love it.  I can't see myself without it now.  I am totally used to the push / pull zoom and now actually like it better.12-2-2008 Update:Found this interesting information and thought I would pass along.The Canon 100-400mm F/4.5-5.6 L IS also has fluorite and Super UD-glass.  Fluorite has very low dispersion so the 100-400 exhibits less chromatic aberration than if it were made of ordinary glass.  The fluorite lens element  aligns the points of focus of the three primary spectral colors of red, green and blue to meet at one point for ideal correction of chromatic aberration. Also included is UD-glass, which is a special type of optical glass whose properties nearly match those of Fluorite.Bottom line on the fluorite and Super UD-glass, you get the best possible image even though you get a huge 100-400mm zoom range!1-30-2009 Update:I just bought a new Zoo membership and took my daughter with me on my second visit to the zoo.  She brought another lens along and quickly wanted to borrow the 100-400.  There was no going back she didn't want to give it back and clicked off one perfect photo after another including the Male Baboon photo I posted with the photos here.  I am so sold.  Can hardly wait to try this lens at the Renaissance festival next weekend.5-26-2009 100-400 update:  So I came back from the Riparian Bird Preserve yesterday where it was rather dusty and I noticed that my sensor and mirror box were full of dust.  I decided to do a test on my 100-400 lens and sure enough it does pump dust into the camera body.If you turn the zoom friction ring all the way loose and zoom in and out with the bottom end cap off there is no resistance.  If you put the bottom end cap on tightly and zoom you can feel resistance.  Then if you loosen the end cap just a little you can actually feel air being sucked in and out around the end cap as you zoom in and out.Thank God for my FIrefly digital sensor cleaning system!  Be forewarned if you own this lens you will need to take care in dusty environments.6-27-2009Still very in love with this lens.  You can see a lot the photos I have taken with it at a web site called flickr.  They won't allow me to put a link here anymore but you can go to flickr and search for my name Grant Brummett then look through the photos.

I see people recommending fixed focal length lenses for safaris but you would need at least two if not three fixed lenses to equal this lens, who can afford that?  And how would you get them to your destination?  Most unsharp photo problems can be blamed on camera shake and while IS does a great job the photographer has a job too.  Using a fast shutter speed not only takes care of the sharpness problem but stops animals in their tracks.  How do you alway have a fast shutter speed?  Digital cameras let you set the ISO so you just have to keep on top of the available light situation.  Old film users like me like 100 ISO but we have to let go of that and move on to 400, 600, even 1000 ISO when the light demands it.  Modern digital cameras can still give you great photographs at those speeds if you will let them.  I have a photo from a Canon 20d on my wall that is 32 X 24 inches taken with this lens at 500 ISO that is tack sharp.  And I will remind you that this lens on a 20d equals a 160-640mm lens.  Many of my animal photographs have been taken at the maximum length with great hand held results.  I try to keep the shutter speed at least at 1/320 or faster unless I am looking for a special effect.  Too many people blame lenses for soft focus when it is shutter speed that is to blame.  I am currently using a 40d with this lens and for wild animal photography I would say that it is close to the best combination available today as it extends this lens to 640mm. Yes, fixed focal length lenses are great but how many can you carry and what if you have your 400mm lens on your camera when an elephant walks up to within 30 feet of you?

Most reviews were glowing, and from reviewers who advised \"just do it\". But there were also some from people who had a \"less than expected\" experience. I really needed the variable reach and at least 400mm of it at times, and also really needed fast and accurate AF for sports, so this seemed like the one to try. I've now logged over 3000 shots, and only wound up with about 20 that weren't properly focused (most of these were my fault since I was using ONE SHOT focusing mode on my camera).I now have to say - absolutely amazing results.When I got the lens, I played around with the Canon 50D lens micro focusing adjustment for an entire evening in low light, and with the LCD moire test pattern approach, and couldn't find a better setting than the default \"+/- 0\" for BOTH 100mm & 400mm zoom points. Then, on the soccer field, this lens blew me away with its clarity. And while I know that several people have complained about its bokeh, I couldn't disagree more - what I got was beautiful. Background spectators, coaches, tree's, and sky were all very nicely blurred - no artifacts and nothing strange at all, and this made each image subject stand out brilliantly.I shot sunshine one day, and pouring rain the next. Both gave me excellent results. I shot ISO400, F8 (bright day) and ISO500, F7.1 (overcast) on a monopod with the focus range limited on the lens to 6.5m and IS mode 2 (allows for panning). Based on all of the reviews, and my own experimenting between F5.6 and F8 indoors, I opted to shoot at F8 or F7.1 to extend the DOF a bit, and get the crispest images possible.I used ONE SHOT AF with center focus set on the camera. The results were fast, accurate, and as I said - left me with amazing images that were tack sharp. The Canon 50D also does a great job outdoors with ISO400 & 500, so no real sacrifice there to shoot stopped down a bit.Push-pull zoom? I wondered about this too from all the negative press in some of the reviews. I found the push-pull action (with adjustable friction) to be PERFECT for shooting on a pod. One other advantage point not made by others, that I discovered in the pouring rain - when you're outfitted with a rain bonnet over the lens and camera, it's trivial to push-pull the zoom in and out with your wet \"free\" hand with the camera and lens completely protected. This would NEVER have worked with a rotating zoom ring on the lens, as I was constantly going from 100mm to 400mm and all points in between as the action moved around quickly on the field.I would like to try the 1.4 extender with this lens and birds/wildlife, but think it would be a waste of time for sports, with baseball being the possible exception, since you lose AF capability with this lens. That would never have worked for me shooting soccer. As an experiment, I was also able to shoot about half a soccer game hand held, without the monopod, using IS mode 1 in bright sun, and got VERY good results as well, but did notice the camera/lens weight after a while. Fatigued arms tend to shake more, and controlled breathing won't help this, so I'd recommend a monopod or tripod for extended shooting. The lens mount for this leaves a very nicely balanced set-up that isn't always trying to fall forwards or backwards on your mount.In closing, I have to second everyone else who's written \"just do it, you won't be sorry\" on this lens. And if you are sorry, you've probably gotten a bad copy and I'd recommend returning it or sending it in to Canon for a tune-up. This lens CAN really deliver - I now have lots of proof. One other thing - I have been watching the rumor mill for Canon to release its F4 update version of this lens. Like others, I figured as soon as I bought the F4.5-5.6, they'd announce the new one a day later. Couple of points on that - (1) you might still be sitting, waiting, this time next year, and have missed some great shots, (2) if Canon rolls out a fixed F4, you KNOW it's going to cost a lot more, and (3) I believe Canon has steadily and quietly been making improvements to their 100mm-400mm all along; you can see a lot more \"recent buyers\" really, really happy with the copy they got, and older versions (especially those bought used) as the ones people complain most about.

Surprisingly hand-heldable, considering the weight. IS helps a GREAT DEAL.2. Zoom is extremely smooth, way better than the twist and zoom on my Sigma 170-500. And it doesn't creek! (amazing engineering. In comparison, my old Tamron 18-250 and Sigma 170-500 immediately extend to the full length with a loud thunk when pointing downwards, while my new 18-270 is so tight it's hard to zoom in and out). This is my first push-pull zoom and there is no learning curve at all. I love it!3. No issue with so called dust pump problem - actually the Sigma and the much smaller Tamron 18-250 suck in more air than this one - you can easily tell by put you hand at the back of the lens and zoom back the lens and feel the air flow for yourself.4. The lens balances extremely well on 40D and 5D without grip. The Sigma feels significally top heavy in comparison.5. The color and contrast is L lens at its best, thanks to its quality glasses.6. The length is quite managable actually, but a very thick lens nevertheless. The Sigma 170-500 is quite slim in comparison.7. The AF is very responsible and assuring, even in modest indoor light (blinders partially closed). There is no comparison between the Canon L ring type USM and the regular Sigma AF.8. IS works SEAMLESSLY. No noise, no ify in-between states. It works its magic without my awareness. Tamron and cheaper Canon like 70-300 announce their IS effects in distinctive and sometimes unnerving noises.9. Background blur is milky smooth if you give enough distance between your subject and the background. My 70-200/F4L has a much more nervous blur in comparison.10. Very LOW CA (color fringe, purple ring etc) at the long end. This is another nice surprise to me since I've heard many saying otherwise about this lens.11.

Putting this in perspective, this is a rather \"cheap\" and light weight tele comparing to the other fast tele primes/zooms. I tried out the Bigma in a Tokyo store several years ago and I didn't like the feel of it, the zoom, balance, IQ - didn't use it on tripod at the time.Con:None so far.Bottom line:A very hand-heldable tele zoom with great overall IQ. This is perhaps in the same vein as the Canon 70-200/F4L, 24-105L and 17-40L, relatively affordable with all the L lens advantages with great convenience and assured consistent IQ (AF speed and accuracy, weight balance in hand, mechanical quality all contributes to the end results of course) But they are certainly not the fastest or the sharpest lens on the market.

Some copies aren't as good as mine is (believe me, I don't say that about all my lenses!).  My suspicion is that newer copies are on average better than old ones.  Check out whichever copy you get while you can still return it.2)  Image quality drops a bit on a full-frame camera if you don't stop down at least one stop (to f/8 or f/11) and preferably back off slightly from 400mm to 370 or so.

This is likely due to wide variations in sample lenses.  I decided to take a chance and seem to have gotten lucky.  My copy, just received from Amazon (Build date of Oct 2005) produces fantastically crisp and contrasty images on my 20D at ALL focal lengths from 100 to 400.  It's almost magical.  The images are much sharper using the same f-stops than those from a 70-200 f2.8IS lens at 100-150mm and virtually the same at 200mm.  Even wide-open at 400mm this lens is quite sharp.  At 400mm, I've compared to a very nice Canon 400mm f5.6L prime lens, with and without 1.4X teleconverter.  The images have virtually the same extreme sharpness and contrast if the zoom is stopped down just one one-third stop (e.g. zoom at 6.3, prime at 5.6).  With the 1.4X TC both lenses had to be manually focused but produced outstanding clarity with NO perceivable loss in quality.  The focus is swift and true and the IS on this lens really works (and does not hum like that on the 70-200 f2.8IS) allowing handheld shots at 1/100 sec at 400mm.  It may be that Canon has quietly improved this lens since recent reviews seem to be much more positive than those from a few years ago.  Some folks don't like the push-pull zoom but it works great for me and allows very fast composition of scenes.

The IS works really well and allows hand-held use, even in relatively dim light, if you are willing to crank up the ISO enough. I have taken some pictures I was very pleased with at about 7pm in the evening by using ISO 800 and, upon occasion, ISO 1600. Otherwise this lens needs either a monopod or, preferably, a tripod.The barrel slides in and out smoothly making it easy to frame your picture and the auto-focus works well. Fast and quiet. I have not had a problem with the AF hunting except in very low light. Except at 400mm the pictures are sharp and clear and, when the lens is fully open, the DOF is nice and slim allowing the subjects of the photo to really stand out. Even at 400mm this lens is much better than my Tamron 200-400 in terms of clarify and, what softness I did find at 400mm, was easily corrected in Photoshop. All in all a very nice lens except that  ...1) This lens is heavy. I know other people have said the same thing, but it did not become clear to me until I tried to use this lens as a \"walk-around\" lens. After about 30 minutes it started to become a real problem. And, because I was using this lens on an entry level DSLR (the Canon T1i) it felt as though the lens was not secure in the camera mount. The lens is so much heavier than the camera.2) This lens is long and there is no lens lock switch as on some other zoom lenses. There is a barrel tension adjustment which, I suppose, is supposed to help keep the lens from \"creeping\", but it did not prevent the lens from extending to its full length when I used it. Since the lens, including the lens hood, is 14\" long when extended, I found the lens handing down to my knees if I did not hold the lens when walking.3) Canon provides a very nice padded lens case, but no case strap. The vendor I bought this from (Canoga Camera) provided a lens strap, but it was thin and without padding so using it became painful after a bit. It might be worth purchasing a padded lens case strap.4) Obviously, because of the length of this length even when closed, you cannot expect to use the built-in flash without creating unsightly shadows in your picture, but I had no problems using even my small (270EX) Canon SpeedLite.5) A comment. Some reviewers have warned against using cheap UV filters. I bought a UV filter which I believed to be just fine, but it caused really unsightly blurring in the pictures I took when I viewed them at 40% or more. I initially thought the problem was the lens and could not believe such an expensive lens would take such bad pictures. But after I removed the filter and re-took the pictures I realized that the problem was the filter, not the lens. Be careful if you buy a UV filter to make sure it does not adversely affect your pictures.I use my camera and lenses mostly away from home. I like to hike through the National Parks in the West and that generally means climbing up and down on a regular basis. Given that usually I also carry either a monopod or a tripod, it makes it difficult to use this lens as a \"walk-around\" lens. I need one hand to hold the lens, another to hold the monopod and a third to help me get up or down some of the hills. So to use this lens I would have to leave it in the case (swinging back and forth as I climb) so that I have at least one hand free, or use a back pack. Either of those means leaving the lens un-mounted and having to then constantly mount and un-mount the lens to take pictures.Given all of this I would recommend this lens if you expect to use it close to home (or car, or camp site) and do not expect to have to do much hiking. Under these circumstances this is a wonderful lens. Otherwise you are going to have to be constantly mounting and un-mounting it to take pictures. Not only is that trouble, but it means you are going to lose a lot of spontaneous shots because you will not be prepared.If, like I, you expect to be climbing or walking in rough areas, I would recommend a smaller lens. I reluctantly returned this lens and expect to replace it with the Canon 70-300 DO.

This lens dominates its niche. It delivers on its promises and is one of the classic white L lenses.I got this lens to supplement the 28-135 IS, but I've ended up rarely using it. In fact, Ive decided that there may be a better choice for many photogs.First let me begin by stating the obvious. Most images taken with this lens here and on online galleries like photosig or photo*net are taken at 400mm. Duh! I was hunting last weekend and took this lens along shooting animal pics from a blind.  I set it to 400 and left it there.  For wildlife and landscape shooters in particular, if the lens is going to be used at 400mm practically all the time, I think a better choice might be the 400mm 5.6 prime- costs hundreds less and sharper to boot. Going a step further, one sucessful wildlife photog I know recommends that if you are thinking about shooting wildlife other than birds, forego 400mm(prime or zoom)and get the 300mm F4 prime. His opinion: the larger size of most mammals offsets the loss of that last 100mm, yet is sharper, has lower light perfomance for the times of day when most mammals start moving, and yes, less money.On the other hand, if your passion is shooting animals in a zoo, maybe this lens is for you. Dont have to worry about dawn or dusk shots and the range of the zoom might come in handy.Sports shooters might actually benefit from the zoom's ability to adjust to capture unpredictable shots, but unless youre right on the sideline I still suspect it will be left at 400 most of the time, so ditto the prime. Ive read that 5.6 can be a bit slow for for fast shutter speeds in anything but optimum light. Of course, the next step up, the 400mm F4 is over five grand, so 5.6 is the practial limit for most average consumers.In either case, you will be able to substantially reduce this handicap IF you have a sensor that takes good pics at ISOs of 800 or above. Thats not every camera.I put the lens on my 30D to check the aperture progression for you techies out there.  The lens shows F4.5 100~135mm, F5.0 ~135~270mm, and F5.6 thereafter.People and portraits? Thats where it gets trickier. I can see using 400mm compression for compositional reasons in an environmental portrait, but how much is that market segment? 100mm isnt a bad length for people pics, but doing long-distance photojournalistic stuff had me feeling like I was Magnum PI on a stakeout.If you're like me and the majority of your work involves people and portraits, the 70-200 2.8 (even non IS) is a much better choice for around the same money. I would have gotten 100x the use out of it over the past year.I bought this one before I really had the need for it, thinking I would expand my horizons, and it just never happened.But this lens does shine with its strengths. IS allows you to handhold 400mm pics with greater success than the non-IS prime. I dont do weddings but I can imagine IS allowing this lens as a supplement when a photog is stuck at the back of a church during the ceremony... as long as the lights arent too low.Right after I got it I was in DC and snapped a few pics of George Bush at the Capitol. Im nobody special and couldnt get any closer than the \"Nobody Special\" section...not close! This lens got usable pics that I could have cropped way down and still had good resolution close-ups. One of those pics is posted in the customer images here.Other benefits? The push-pull design allows almost instant adjustments. Because it compresses, its easer to carry than the prime (length- and size-wise, not weight). And, in spite of the fact that I use it far less than I imagined, I have no plans to get rid of the thing.So the question boils down to whether you really need the zoom, the IS, and the ranges of this lens at the higher price than the prime.  Wildlife/landscape photogs that use tripods? Maybe not. Sports shooters with monopods? Maybe. People shooters like me? I've learned almost never, unless I someday find myself a private detective or a voyeur.That said, if you weigh your wants and this lens still tugs at your heart, dont hesitate to buy it.

But before you make the $350 plunge here are few useful things to know about how it can be used. Keep in mind that I use this lens on the Rebel XT (1.6 factor), which means it provides me with an angel of view similar to 135mm on film cameras.SHARPNESS: Yes that's one feature you can count on when buying this lens. This lens produces very sharp pictures. So much so that it will blow away your 18-55 kit lens (if you have one) and all other zoom lenses.  Exception to that are the L-series zooms. The sharpness difference will be obvious even in the smallest of prints (4 by 6). If you can't envision such difference then consider this. Sharpness can be viewed as contrast between the edges of different color objects. Hence, the sharper an image the greater the contrast in the edges between such groups of color. This lens captures the contrast in such setting better than most other lenses.SPEED: This lens is blazingly fast. As such you will have the opportunity to shoot at higher shutter speeds wide open (remember the inverse relation between aperture and shutter speed). More importantly you gain the ability to shoot in low light situations (concert for example) and still maintain a decent shutter speed for handholding. Here's the best part, if you're like most new people to photography, you probably plan to take self portraits. This lens will give you that ability, as you will be able to buy few clamp on lights coupled with 100-150W bulbs and start shooting at medium ISO speeds wide open.ANGEL OF VIEW: Assuming you will be using this lens on a 1.6 digital format consider that you will be having a tight crop, more like that of a 135mm lens on a film camera (1.6*85=136). What does that translate to in practical terms? You will have to stand 6-8 feet away from your subject to be able to cover their head and shoulders at landscape orientation.SPECIAL EFFECTS: Here are two special effects you will find useful in this lens depth of field and compression. To some degree or another every lens offers depth of field, which can be summarize as having only the subject of interest in focus and the rest of the picture blurred. This lens is unique in that it creates a very shallow depth of field in which the subject is truly isolated from the whole scene. Set the aperture to 1.8 and focus correctly and you can achieve such results. More importantly the lens quality of such blur (known as bokeh) is outstanding as there are eight diaphragm blades that control the aperture opening vs. 5 or 6 in many other lenses.As for compression, since the camera is a telephoto it will compress everything in its sight closer together to fit in its sight. For example, if you are photographing a person, their face will look wider and their nose will look smaller or flatter. Keep in mind that unlike some of the longer telephoto lenses (300mm for example) the effect with this lens is subtle and pleasantSIZE AND BUILD: Its size and weight are perfect! It balances my XT very nicely. So much so, that I can take pictures at very low shutter speeds with this combination (though I don't find my self doing that that often with this fast lens). All this translates to comfort and confidence when I am shooting with this lens. The build quality is excellent, I find no inherit weakness in the design.If you plan to photograph friends and family then this is the lens. You will take sharp pictures with the right kind of effects for portraits like compression and beautiful bokeh. The lens is fast and designed excellently for maximum control and comfort. You won't miss a shot because of shake with slow shutter speeds and even if you do (that's a big if) you can put its speed to use by dialing a higher aperture. It's only draw back is that it has a pretty tight angel of view on 1.6 factor SLRs. I can't think of any other prime in the non-L canon line up that matches this lens (other than possibly the 50mm 1.4). Truly an incredible value, buy it with confidence!Ps. By no means does this review cover all the merits of this lens. To name a couple, the lens offers precise auto focus and low chromatic aberration. Rather, I covered the features that were most useful for its intended purpose; taking pictures of people.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Do you really need this lens?", "unixReviewTime": 1144022400, "reviewTime": "04 3, 2006"}

It does not come with the appropriate hood, the Canon ET-65 III. You get both a lens cap and a mount cap, all packed inside tight conformal foam to protect the lens during shipping. There's also a very brief manual and the usual warranty paperwork.The lens offers AF and manual focus, and allows manual focus even when AF is set to on, a very useful feature for low-light and other challenging focus situations. This is a USM lens, and as a direct consequence focus is fast and precise, just as you'd expect.The AF/Manual switch is in a reasonable location, close to the camera body. There is a range indication on the barrel of the lens behind a transparent window which serves to keep dust and debris out of the workings of the lens. Manual focus is controlled with a broad, easy to manage textured ring about mid-body on the lens. During focus, nothing external on the lens body moves or rotates, so there are no complications for using polarizing filters, and no concerns about the lens \"pumping\" air and so causing dust contamination in either the lens or camera with use.The lens lacks any form of image stabilization. IS is showing up in more and more lenses, though for the price... perhaps this is one of the justifications for building IS into the camera body. I'm sure that this design wouldn't be anywhere near its current price point with IS added to the build. One last point is that since the lens is a fairly fast design, perhaps there is less overall need for IS (though that argument falls completely apart the first time you *do* need it!)It takes a 58mm filter, though I highly recommend the use of the ET-65 III hood rather than a filter; filter use should be limited to polarizers, neutral density filters and so on, rather than keeping a filter on the lens with the idea of protecting it. Here's why: filters create a flat surface over the end of the lens that can (and often does) create low-level reflections. These are most apparent in low-light shots, but they are almost always there. In the case of a UV filter, no other benefit is gained (UV can't get through the lens system anyway) other than physical protection. The hood, however, keeps the lens out of harms way quite effectively, and it increases contrast and reduces flare at the same time by preventing light from entering the lens at high angles of attack. I have shot with both hoods and filters, and after decades of experience, I have to come down firmly on the side of hood technique. It only takes one shot ruined by a filter reflection to wake up to this reality; and hoods never, ever compromise an image. They're simply the best way to go. Finally, the hood for this lens is inexpensive, well worth the extra few dollars it costs.Aperture is controlled by an 8-blade system. The available f-stops range from f/1.8 wide open to f/22.0 fully stopped down. MTF (sharpness) peaks at f/5.6, and vignetting is almost gone by that setting.On my camera, an EOS 50D, resolution loss from diffraction effects begin at f/7.6, so in many ways, the \"sweet spot\" for this lens for me lands naturally at f/5.6. On a camera with a lesser sensel density such as the 40D, diffraction doesn't set in until higher f-stops, but you're beginning to lose sharpness from other effects, so I'd still call the sweet spot as f/5.6 (which also provides a fairly extensive depth of field) for shots where detail is the primary consideration.For portraits, you'll want to go right for f/1.8 if lighting conditions allow in order to take advantage of the shallow and pleasing DOF isolation this lens is famous for; background blur is very soft yet very strong, while the in focus region remains deep enough to keep the important features of the face in focus from ear to nose. The loss of MTF at f/1.8 is noticeable, especially once you get a feel for how the lens performs at f/5.6, but in my opinion, the compromise is perfectly acceptable in a portrait context. There's another benefit as well; at 85mm, and especially on a crop body like the 40D or 50D, this lens allows you to get some distance from your subject which tends to make them more comfortable, while giving you the modest compression that is the hallmark of any telephoto lens. Portraits \"pop\" and backgrounds blur away with commendable speed. Head-and-shoulders work will put you at about eight feet, and as the lens can focus down to just under three feet, this gives you considerable control over framing without ever running into a limit imposed by the lens design.This is also a truly excellent lens for not-very-wide field astrophotography, although at critical focus and maximum aperture, chromatic aberration will make itself felt on the brightest stars, which you will then have to compensate for. I have successfully used this lens to capture the the Orion nebula, Andromeda galaxy, Triangulum galaxy, and a number of other astro objects that range from the easy to the difficult, all using no more than a standard (non-tracking) tripod, this lens, and the EOS 50D. On a crop body, 85mm (136mm effective FOV) is definitely the place to be to compromise between star trailing and magnification, and the f/1.8 aperture allows fast enough exposures to eliminate trailing at ISO 1600 and above.I carry this lens nested in a large camera bag (a Tamrac 5612 Pro 12, *highly* recommended); I rarely put the lens on the camera until I am ready to use it, and when I am done, I take it right back off, cap it, and bag it without wasting any time or motion. I do both the assembly and disassembly \"blind\" in the bag, using the bag top to shield the camera and lens from the wind and environment as best I can manage. The lens has a raised alignment dot that makes blind assembly practical. It's the size of the overall investment that drives this behavior, of course; both the camera and a lens like this deserves -- demands -- good care and that is just what I try to provide.Physically speaking, this lens isn't as large as you might think. Canon did a great job of packing a lot of glass (nine elements in seven groups) into a decent form factor of 3\" diameter by 2.8\" long; even with the hood mounted, this lens provides a fraction of the intimidation factor of, for instance, the 70-200mm f/2.8L. But at 85mm, it can still \"get in there\" and catch a lot of action without forcing you to crop to extremes. It's light enough that you can shoot for quite a while before fatigue sets in, an issue that will rear its head in any situation that goes on a while, like a wedding or a play (and that low-light capability is great for stage work, where a flash annoys literally everyone.) Plus it is black, and so looks more like it is designed as part of the same camera system, unlike the L's with the white bodies. That's also less distracting in a dark theater.I can honestly say that this is definitely one of my favorite lenses. I have a fair collection of primes to compare it to, some of which are L glass, and I've got some great L zooms as well; yet for portraits, I inevitably turn to this specific lens as it outperforms everything else I own in the successful shooting methodologies I find myself returning to over and over. Frankly, at the price, I think it is perfectly fair to characterize this lens as a \"must-have\"; if you're ever going to shoot a portrait, trust me, this is the lens you want (even over the 85mm f/1.2L, which has far too narrow a depth of field for most reasonable portraiture, though you can't beat it for light-gathering.) Like Canon's 100mm f/2.8 macro lens, the 85mm f/1.8 is one of those where you're left scratching your head as to why it doesn't have an \"L\" designation. It is an outstanding performer.If Canon were to re-do this lens, I'd like to see them add image stabilization, and perhaps some modern anti-CA elements, as this is the one area where this lens occasionally bites the photographer in high-contrast situations. Until that day, though, this lens is unmatched by anything else in Canon's line for price/performance, and I can't imagine anyone ever regretting its purchase.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "One of Canon's best for price/performance", "unixReviewTime": 1227052800, "reviewTime": "11 19, 2008"}

The macro in 100mm was tempting, even though I'm not a big fan, but it's a fun feature.  85, on the other hand, was faster, and as someone who prefers to shoot with available light, it was a big plus.I ended up deciding that either lens was going to be great, and went with the cheapest, which was 85mm.  It's fantastic.  If you're thinking about upgrading from 50mm 1.8 - you'll be blown away.

That is not to say that the under 400 dollar price tag makes it fall into a category with other lens of the same price, because this lens is leagues above most lens at this price. It feels easily as solid as the L glass that ive used, and is small and compact. The AF is super fast (ring type USM, I hate non ring type lens'), and with a 1.8 aperture, you can shoot in really low light. I just used this lens for a college hockey game (notoriously bad lighting) and was able to get some amazing captures. Just to put it in perspective, even a 70-200 f/2.8 would be almost unusable in that light. I was able to shoot as fast as 1/1000 at ISO 800 f/1.8. To be able to shoot with that fast of a shutter speed indoors is amazing. Plus, the 85 is built like a rock, it feels so solid. The first time you pick it up, I promise you will be surprised at how good it feels to hold, especially if you arent used to L glass.Be warned though, this is not a portrait lens! On a 1.6 crop body like the xti it is approx. equal to a 135mm on a full frame. that means you have to stand roughly 13 yards back from a subject to get their whole body into the picture. In a room this lens is very very tight. Shooting from the corner of a rink its perfect for net shots, shooting from the corner of a room doesnt work so well, and thats where you WILL find yourself trying to take people pictures. If you want a portrait go for the 50mm f/1.8 or f/1.4, or even a 35 f/2. But if you are looking for a fast low light sports or concert lens this is it! Some head and shoulder shots are doable, dont get me wrong, but if your main intent is portraits you will be disappointed (as an outdoor lens its fine since you always have enough room but for group shots you will have to stand far away).

This is what I've found:1) Bar none, the best \"portrait\" lens I own.  There's just something about this 85mm focal length + f/1.8 that brings out detail....faces have so much dimension with this lens, they look 3 dimensional.  When I want to get shots of my daughter that amaze, I use this lens.  When I look at my picture archive on my computer, I can easily spot the ones taken with this 85mm.  My friends, some of which who don't know much about photography, pick pictures taken with this lens as their favorites - they ask wow how did you get that picture?  I have a few blown up pictures to 16x20 and 11x14 of my daughter for my parents from this lens which are magnificent.2) I thought that when I bought my 70-200L I would never use my 85mm again, I was wrong.  I routinely find myself putting on the 85mm and shooting pictures with it.  Also, Its much lighter and less imposing than my 70-200L so when I just want amazing portraits, don't need the higher 200mm and don't want the weight, and want a real shallow depth of feel and out of focus backgrounds, I go for the 85mm.3) I also have a 16-35mm L which I use quite a bit for inside shots and panoramas which stays on my camera most of the time but there's just a special look to the longer mm rating that you get which makes portraits just work better with the 85mm - so when I take off the 16-35, I usually mount this 85mm.4) I really thought that between the 16-35mm L and the 70-200L, I'd never ever use the 85mm, I was wrong.  There are wonderful advantages to this lens which make it a keeper for me....the construction on this lens has held up very well, after years it looks brand new.  I do have a UV/Haze filter that I use as a protector I got from Amazon (about $25) - great value.There's allot to be said for a non \"L\" lens which consistently winds up on my camera when I own several \"L\"s which cover the mm of this lens.  To me, its an L: built like an L, color and saturation comparable to an L  It's my \"L\" lens that doesn't have a red stripe.Original Review:I bought a 20D recently with the 18-55mm kit lens and to start out I bought a 50mm f/1.8 lens which really got me interested in the faster f/stops to blur backgrounds and take pictures in lower light.  My kit lens was not fast enough (hard to blur background and hard to take pictures in low light) and both the kit lens and 50mm lens did not have Ultrasonic which made me miss focus more often with moving targets.I looked quite a bit and found the 85mm f/1.8 lens.  Although Amazon only had a few reviews, the photography forums I found were buzzing about how this lens should've been labeled an L lens.  Pros might know why but 90% of the reviews I read said it was comparable to an L lens in quality and that it was very affordable.I bought this lens and I have to tell you, I was very impressed with it right from the start.  On construction, its heavier than the kit lens and the plastic 50mm II lens.  It has a metal mount and very solid construction.  If you look through it you can see allot of glass which tells you it has a wide aperture and consequently its much heavier than the kit lens or 50mm lens.  But...its heavy in a good way.  It balances the camera and makes it look like a real camera.So what's good about this lens?  For one, you can take great pictures in low light with the f/1.8.  I photographed a stage play handheld with this lens and no flash (non allowed) and I got tremendous results.  Ultrasonic helped with every picture in focus and all very sharp with vibrant colors, very nice saturation, and I used ISO 400 and I could even freeze the action on stage.As a portrait lens, it really can blow the backgrounds into a very nice buttery blokeh and with the Ultrasonic - I haven't missed focus once.  Its also wonderful for inside pictures with no flash.  The F/1.8 is really versatile.A few notes.  If you're going to get a 70-200 L zoom lens, you might wind up not using this lens as much but for parties, its allot less intimidating than a big white lens.  I hear this lens was designed a long time ago and not really designed for digital and that some strange effects can be seen with it on digitals.  I have not gone looking nor experienced any of these.  Its just a tremendous value at $350.  I was not able to use this lens as a macro as it was not designed as such but I have thought of putting an extension tube on it to see what I get but haven't done so yet.Constructed Solid.

If you're new to digital photography with digital SLR's you're going to want a lens with a low f-stop a.k.a. a faster lens and this is a perfect lens to leave on your camera at all times. Most people like to have a zoom lens on their camera but I'm of the opinion you can always walk closer or further from your subject but a zoom lens will never have this good of an f-stop. And while this lens is expensive ($400 at the time of this review) I'm sure it will become your default lens after only a month of shooting with it.You should always buy a UV filter to protect the glass on any lens you have. This in my opinion is the one thing everybody who purchases an expensive lens should do. UV filters don't affect the photographs you take but it's a layer of plastic between the scratchable glass and the world around you. It's a MUST BUY.Here I'll explain how the f-stop or aperture priority works on digital SLR cameras. Basically the aperture is a circle inside the lens that as you go up in your f-stop from 1.8 to 2.2 to 3.0 and beyond it shrinks the size of this circle in the lens. The shrinking of the circle from a higher f-stop allows less light to pass through to the sensor. The lower the f-stop i.e. 1.8 allows you to shoot at faster shutter speeds in low light situations because the circle in the lens allows more light to pass through because of the lower aperture. Here's an example say are in a well lit room and you're shooting your child (yes that sounds very weird but it's a funny joke anyway). Generally indoors you need to shoot at 1/60 of a second with most lenses they'll instantly autofocus at their lowest f-stop which would be about 4.0. But with this lens since it can go down to 1.8 on the f-stop you could shoot the same picture at 1/125 shutter speed. Resulting in about the same light but avoiding any motion blur that plagues low light photography. Now needs to be noted that as you drop your f-stop you lose depth of field. I.e. how much of your photo will be in focus and how much will be blurred. It's the effect you see on portraits where the person is in focus but the background is blurry.Now I know many people will probably shoot holes in the foregoing explanation of f-stop but I'm not a really advanced photographer but I get how shutter speed and aperture priority work with each other. Buying a lens like this can only help somebody understand how both are related and work together.Here's what I recommend that you do:1. Enable manual mode on your camera this mode allows you to set both the aperture for the lens a.k.a. the f-stop and the shutter speed a.k.a. how long the shutter is opened while taking a photograph.2. Drop the aperture or f-stop to 1.8 on this lens3. Set your shutter speed to 1/60 of a second4. take a picture5. Look at your photograph notice how much is dark and light about it how sharp it is etc.6. Go up to the next shutter speed 1/90th of the second or 1/125 and take another photograph.7. now compare both of the photographs you took8. to change the shutter speed again going up another step taken other photograph now compare all three photographsIf you continue to do this adjust shutter speed while knowing what your aperture is you're going to notice how shutter speed affects the lighting of your photographs all you need to do then is start changing your aperture and repeat the process of stepping through your shutter speeds eventually you'll understand how the aperture works in correlation with shutter speed. I became a proficient photographer using manual controls in less than a month just by doing this simple practice. I would recommend starting outdoors on a well lit day because then you will see how you can adjust your aperture and your shutter speeds to really make good photographs.That's the reason I recommend this lens so highly as it helps you as a beginning photographer to create photographs because the lower f-stop helps you experiment and instantly see your results.Thanks for reading it this was helpful please click the button so others can see it.If you have any questions leave a comment on this review and I'll get back to you if I can help.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "F-stop tips for this great lens.", "unixReviewTime": 1389052800, "reviewTime": "01 7, 2014"}

If possible, I would have given this a 4.5 star review as for my specific needs this lens is not ideal. In it's own right however, it is a great lens as I will explain below.GENERALIn general, this is a great lens. The optical quality is fantastic, it is built like a tank, and any photographer will tell you that the 85mm focal length is definitely the sweet spot for portraits. The bokeh is creamy wide open, and definitely higher quality that the 50mm 1.8 or even the 50mm 1.4. When stopped down a little, the images it produces are quite sharp, have very decent color (if a TINY bit dull in some situations) and I like that it produces such powerful results in a relatively small package.FOR PORTRAITUREThis is probably the best non-L glass around for portraits, and I would venture to say that in the right hands it can produce L-quality results. As I mentioned, the bokeh alone makes this an incredible choice for your portraits, whether with just one subject or a couple. What I like especially about the 85mm range, is that you have to be pretty far back from your subject for a traditional head-and-shoulders portrait, which I have found makes people feel quite relaxed especially those uncomfortable around a camera. I always use a manual focus point for portraits, focusing in on my subject's eye before snapping the shot. In a relaxed environment such as this, the lens works perfectly and turns out great results...FOR WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHYYou might not think it, but Wedding Photography is one of the fastest paced photography categories, barring sports. The need to capture THAT moment in fact defines this profession, and therefore we wedding photographers need our gear to act right, and at the right time. Whether memory cards, DSLR cache or in this case lens focusing systems, it really irks me when I don't get the shot that I wanted. I have found when shooting weddings that this lens is less than ideal. I like to shoot without flash 95% of the time (venue allowing) and so all of my lenses are wide aperture such as this. The problem is, the focusing system on the 85mm is a little slow, so that I frequently noticed images coming out soft to the point of being blurry, as I don't have the time to wait for it to catch up. Initially thinking this might be a calibration problem, both my 1Ds MkII and my 85mm 1.8 went in for testing/calibration at Canon, both coming back with the okay. I tried a friend's copy of the lens, and came back with similar results. There are several forums that discuss this topic, and I found that many photographers found this same caveat with their lenses. When it does focus, it is spot on every time, but when the couple is having their first kiss, often you don't have more than a second or two to get it right.OVERALLIf you are looking for a good portrait lens, are a beginner or novice user, you are absolutely going to love this lens. Even some pros will enjoy it in many situations. If you are specifically a wedding photographer, or someone who shoots faster-paced scenes, you might want to look at a different lens. On paper, this lens should work for these uses, but in real life, I have found it to be less than ideal. This lens has earned a permanent spot in my gear bag, and I use it often and with pleasure, it does not however make appearances at weddings unless the bride and groom set aside a couple of hours for bridals, which doesn't happen all that often!4.5/5", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Review from a wedding photographer", "unixReviewTime": 1331596800, "reviewTime": "03 13, 2012"}

Canon lenses can be grouped into 3 basic categories - EF and EF-S non USM, EF and EF-S with USM, and L.  The EF-S lenses are specifically designed for Canon cameras using the APS-C sensor (the Rebels, the 7D, the 10/20/30/40/50D).  The non-USM versions of these lenses are traditionally considered 'kit lenses' (ones that are packaged with cameras - for example the 18-55 EF-S or the 55-250 EF-S that often come with the Rebel series) and are traditionally considered 'beginner' lenses.  They lack the ultrasonic motor driven autofocus (USM) and they aren't manufactured to the same optical standards as Canon's better lenses - this isn't a knock on the lenses, because the fact is that Canon needs a series of lenses that fit the specific price range these lenses occupy. For the casual photographer these lenses perform great.  From these you move into the EF or EF-S USM lenses that use the ultrasonic motor driven autofocus - they are quieter, faster focusing, and also a bit more solidly constructed.  Consider these the 'mid-range' lenses in terms of price and performance, with some lenses in this category excelling to the point where they could be used without any reservation in professional settings.  Finally you have the L-series - these are Canon's top of the line lenses (when you watch a sporting event and notice the sea of white/cream colored lenses on the photographer's cameras you are seeing L-series glass in action).  I own several L-series lenses, with my favorite being the 24-70 F2.8 (read my review on it if you are interested in this lens).  These lenses are expensive - prohibitively expensive to many - but if you can save up for one, you won't regret the purchase.  Note that this little primer didn't mention image stabilization - this feature can be found in each category of lens - I tend to think that people put too much emphasis on it, but it can certainly be useful.Now, on to this lens.  The 85mm F1.8 would fit into that 'mid-range' category in regards to its price. Performance-wise, however, this lens is professional grade without question.  It's L-series counterpart, the 85mm F1.2 is about $1300 more expensive - and while the jump to a max aperture of 1.2 is nice, many people just don't see it as being worth the additional cost when compared to this lens.The 85 F1.8 is pin sharp across its entire aperture range, producing beautifully blurred backgrounds and extremely shallow depth of field at F1.8 on both full frame cameras like the 5D and 1Ds series and on crop factor bodies as well.  It is a hugely popular portrait lens - I'd go so far as to say it is a \"must own\" for a portrait photographer. At F1.8 it produces crisp eyes in portraits with silky smooth backgrounds - turning something as simple as the front yard into a perfect backdrop for a portrait. For beginners - the number after the \"F\" is the aperture - the lower the number, the wider the hole the light goes through and thus the more of the lens that is used.  Many lenses tend to be a bit softer when they are set to the max aperture for that lens because it requires more of the lens to be used in focusing the image, letting imperfections at the edges of the lens come into play and impact sharpness.  I've been extremely pleased with the sharpness of this lens its max aperture.Additionally - on a crop factor body like the Rebel series (or the 50D or 7D), this lens has an effective focal range of 136mm (85 x 1.6 = 136 - contact me personally if you need help understanding why I did this calculation - you can get my email address by going to my website - [...]).  This makes it a decent mid range telephoto lens with - being able to shoot at 136mm at F1.8 is great for indoor sports photography such as basketball.  Again, for beginners, the more light your lens can let in (the lower the max aperture number) the faster your shutter speed can be indoors.All in all, this lens is extremely versatile.  This lens and the 100mm F2.8 macro (the older version) are the two non-L series lenses that I have no reservations using in ANY professional situation.  I cannot recommend it enough and if you plan on doing any portrait photography you owe it to yourself to pick this lens up.  For the price, its performance simply cannot be beat.I'm happy to answer any and all questions (that I can) about this lens or cameras and lenses in general.

F/1.8 is great, although the lens is sharper at f/2 or 2.2. I use it near the wide open edge all the time - indoor gyms simply do not have much light.The USM autofocus is great - demoing it in the store, it seemed to nearly anticipate my actions. No rotating front filter, and it doesn't protrude, either. It's got a full time manual focus ring, so I don't have to worry about killing my autofocus  motor. In combination with c.Fn 4-1, this is killer.Why the four stars? Chromatic aberration at lower apertures. I do not know where it starts to go away, because I almost never shoot in good light.

Nevertheless, an alien-like purple halo surrounded the huddled offensive team. Oh well, you can't have it all!As for volleyball pics, this is the lens. I regularly shoot at f/2.2, ISO 1600, and 1/500, but I might change that soon because that is pushing it. The photos are pretty sharp and the USM definitely helps here. I bought this lens because my 50mm 1.8 just wasn't cutting it - I'd get shots with a tack sharp background and a beautifully bokeh'd subject - just the opposite of what it should be. Using the 85mm removed about 85% of those shots. There are still extreme instances when I swing my camera around and instantly shoot when the USM can't keep up, but there are other instances when I am amazed that it got the shot in focus. From the sidelines, 85mm is too long to get the outside hitter nearest to you, but that's why you move around!

Finally one day, I got a very loud crackle-racket when listening, every time I'd bend the wires going into the battery pack.It got worse and worse until now, if you dare turn on the circuitry, you will get the crackle-racket (at about 100dB) without even moving the wires.I did take the unit apart to try to secure the connections but it made no difference.

The Sennheiser's completely blew those out of the water (and to be fair, the Bose given to me on the plane were probably constantly used, thereby affecting their performance).  3) Because the ear piece is round on the Sennheiser, you may wear your earphones in almost any position, however on Bose that is not possible because of the oval shape of the earphone.  4) The earphones didn't disturb me when sleeping.

For straight noise reduction, the PXC 250 is definitely better.  But as a wear-it-everywhere set of headphones to improve one's overall quality of life, the PXC 250 still leaves something to be desired.  (For this latter usage, the HDC 451 might still be a wiser choice.)  Here's a rundown of the PXC 250's pros and cons.On the positive side, noise reduction for the PXC 250 is up 50% versus the HDC 451, going from 10 dB to 15 dB of noise suppression.  Quietness is further enhanced by the 250's on-the-ear, cup-style listening units.  The earphones also twist to lie flat, and the headband folds in two places to make the PXC 250 even smaller for stowing.  The 250 even comes with its own black carrying case, which has a zippered pocket on the outside which is perfect for hiding the included \" audio and two-pronged airline adapter plugs.On the downside, the battery carrying case (which also houses the electronics) has grown significantly - even though the battery size has been reduced from two (2) AA's to a pair of AAA's.  The batteries are held in-line, rather than side-by-side.  So the case for the PXC is about as long and thick as a short cigar, whereas the compartment for the HDC 451 is about the size of a box of Tic Tac mints.The most bothersome feature of the PXC 250, though, are the dual wires emerging from the earphones (one for each side), which are probably required since the headband now breaks in two places.  The wires, besides being more numerous, are also fairly thin -- which causes them to get tangled much more often when storing and unstoring them (as compared to the HDC 451 which has a single, thicker wire).Lastly, the increased quietness of the PXC 250's enclosed ear cups, although superior for blocking noise, are no longer an \"open air\" style - which makes hearing ambient sounds and other people's voices more difficult.  The PXC 250 is thus best suited to indoor (or stationary) music listening only, and are perhaps a little too insulating for using outdoors (or while moving or interacting with others).In short, if enjoying music indoors (or on a plane) is your objective, the PXC 250 is definitely the way to go.  If, on the other hand, you'd like to bring sanity to a noisy world by wearing your headphones everywhere, then the older HDC 451 is probably a smarter choice.I'd like to suggest to the company (Sennheiser) that they also consider offering a behind-the-neck style so that outdoor users (like yours truly) can enjoy the benefits of superior noise reduction - while wearing a hat!  And there's definitely something to be learned from the new Bose QuietComfort 2's (which are unfortunately bigger and much more expensive) which incorporate the electronics into the headphones themselves.  This design allows the audio cord to be completely detached - which takes everyday noise suppression to a whole new level of convenience.To conclude, I've tried a variety of affordably priced noise-reducing headphones and earphones from Sony, Aiwa and others.  From my own experiences, the Sennheiser PXC 250 and HDC 451 are definitely the best!  And I certainly wouldn't want to live life without them!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Still one of the best.

My last attempt at a decent headphone for use in a noisy gym was the Shure E3C \"in-ear\" headphones. You can see my review for those in the Sure E3C section. Before trying those out I had been using the Sony MDR-NC20's for the last 6 months. They did cancel the noise out pretty well but the sound was terribly muffled (no highs) the mids seemed squashed to me almost like they were compressed and while the lows were there, they were very mushy. For a while I just figured that this was the price one pays for using noise canceling technology. Then I went on a hunt again and read some good reviews for the Sennheiser PXC250's so I went and purchased a pair. I first just put the batteries in and tried them at home. They sounded great! Rich low-end, brilliant but not harsh highs. Overall a very pleasant EQ curve. But the real test would be at the gym.The ambient noise in this gym is the constant roar of treadmills, stair machines, stationary bikes, etc. Overall these cover a fairly broad frequency spectrum. I put the headphones on and started the music. Oooops! I forgot to turn the noise canceling on. After doing so I couldn't believe my ears. With the music on (and not even too loud) I felt isolated in the room. The sound was absolutely top-notch and turning on the noise cancellation circuitry actually improved the sound quality! While I have tried the Bose noise canceling headphones it was around 6 months ago so I don't feel qualified to do a direct comparison. However, I do not remember them blowing me away like these Sennheisers did.I think it's also important to know what kind of music I used to judge these phones as someone into classical music might looking for a different sound than someone into rock. I have been either a professional musician or otherwise involved in the music industry for the last 40 years. My music types of choice and the genres I used to judge these phones were progressive rock, rock, and fusion jazz. My reference headphones are the Sony MDR-7506's which, to me, are some of the best sounding headphones one can purchase without completely breaking the bank. They are also some of the most used headphones in the studios I worked in and visited. These Sony phones can produce a very low yet articulate bass and smooth mids and highs that are never over bearing.

And I have never been a Bose fan, I'll take fidelity over artificial booming bass any day :)So far I have been very happy with these headphones. They are not cheap (I got them here on a brief special offer, which helped ease the pain a little), but in my opinion, these headphones are definitely worth the money.First, as far as the noise canceling goes: like other reviewers have stated, you have to know what to expect. Total noise isolation? No way. But these phones do a great job of blocking out low-frequency background noise, while preserving input audio quality, with very little 'noise' added. I have not had the opportunity to take them on an airplane, but I've been using them in the office daily, and they do an admirable job of getting rid of the rumble of three computer fans and the air conditioning. The noise canceling makes a huge difference, especially at low audio volumes. Very impressive! When turned on, a slight amplification of the input signal is apparent, accompanied by a tiny amount of high-frequency hiss, not disturbing at all though.Audio quality, with or without noise canceling, is of course way better than with the cheap earbuds you get for free with MP3 players. The PXC250's are not audiophile standard, as are the top of the line Sennheisers (e.g. the HD650), but they produce clear, well-balanced sound, free of any perceptible distortion and with good, tight bass response. I've tried these on my home theater system and I was suitably impressed - very typical neutral Sennheiser sound. Like most audio equipment of decent quality, they seem to improve after a break-in period.The phones are very comfortable to wear: light-weight with adequate padding all round, probably the most comfortable headphones I've ever owned. I can wear these for hours at a time without feeling any fatigue. The included carrying case and converter plugs are a nice touch, like everything with wires attached to it, it takes some time to get the hang of properly folding and stowing them, but they are certainly very portable. The construction seems sturdy enough and I expect these to last a long time with proper use and care.Something to consider: the input impedance is quite high (300 ohms, compared to the more typical 16-32 ohms of cheaper earbuds/phones), so to drive them properly you need some oomph. My Zen Micro manages to drive them to adequate volume levels (I plan on retaining my hearing for a while still), but if you insist on stretching your eardrums to bleeding levels, you may want to consider getting a headphone amplifier if you plan to use these with portable audio devices.All in all, I am very satisfied with my Sennheiser PXC250's.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very satisfied", "unixReviewTime": 1119312000, "reviewTime": "06 21, 2005"}

Not content with them, I went to a Bose Kiosk in a mall and bought the QC2's, also on a 30-day return.  The Kiosk was under an escalator, and the mall was busy - the headphones cut down that background substantially - a test similar to an airplane, I believe.Over the next week, I did a few tests, mostly with a TV at moderate volume in the next room (my major interest other than travel).

The 17-40 L is no exception; in fact it's the best value lens from Canon in my opinion, how so? Consider the following features.RANGE: I use this lens on the Rebel XT. With a 1.6 crop factor this lens will provide an angel of view of 27-64. That's a great range for taking pictures in the forest preserve for example. It would have been nice if the lens was a little longer (more like 80mm on 1.6 a body), but with 8MP and Photoshop crop function does it really matter? Not really, I always crop to create beautiful animal pictures in post processing and still maintain excellent picture quality for prints up to 8-10 inches.SIZE & CONSTRUCTION: Yes I list this second because this lens blows away all other canon lenses that I own in construction quality. Its solid as a tank and it balances the XT so well that I can hand hold it with confidence and comfort. Although it weight 1.1 pounds the lens never felt too heavy, just right.SHARPNESS: very sharp at all apertures, but best by 8.0. I am close to affirming that this lens will produce sharpness at par with many primes at that aperture. That's very impressive if you consider that is still a zoom even if it's an L.CONVENIANCE: Coming from using mostly primes its so much fun to use a zoom like this one. Now I pretty much own 4 lenses in one. Yes think of it as owning the 20mm + 24mm + 28mm + 35mm none L primes for half the price combined. The only draw back is that this lens is 1-2 stops slower than those lenses. Otherwise it's almost or as sharp and more convenient to use.FOCUS DISTANCE: Did you ever see pictures where the foreground is dominated with a small object like a flower and then in the background there is a grand scene of open land? This lens gives you the ability to take those pictures because its closest focusing distance is under 1 foot. That means you will be able to get close to objects compared to other zooms. Don't over estimate the convenience of ultra zooms like 28-300mm. Those lenses restrict your ability to crop and create beautiful composition, because their minimum focus distance is higher. With the 17-40 however, all what you have to do is focus correctly, compose with tight crop, and then shoot at f11-16.DISTORION CONTROL: This lens doesn't come free of distortions, especially so at the wide end where you can notice some barrel distortion. But overall its very capable at controlling distortion. That includes distortions like chromatic aberation, light fall off, vigetting, and flare. It doesn't eliminate those things completely, but controls them so well that such problems will go unnoticeable. I would love to have a distortion free lens. After all, with the challenges of getting lighting and composition right who needs lens distortions to deal with on the top of those two things? But the fact to the matter is that all lenses have some level of distortion and this lens is pretty good at controlling them especially if you take its price into account and that's what I will discuss next.VALUE: At the $600 range this lens offers an incredible value. No other lens in that price range offers the same quality build, distortion control, and image quality. The best part however, is that this lens holds its value really well. You can sell it used if you ever have to for close to what you bought it for. Now that's a lens I can't refuse!There are many great value lenses, but each comes with a weakness. For example, the 50mm is very cheap in construction and the 85mm is soft on the wide end. The 17-40 L on the other hand is just amazing! It did not disappoint me in anyway except possibly its limited reach on the upper end (40mm only). Otherwise I see no weakness in this lens. Some people may consider the 4.0 maximum aperture too low, but it served my landscape and nature needs incredibly well. If you need an extra stop for portrait or no flash concerts get the 16-35 2.8.

I deliberated this decision for over a month, having physically tested both lenses on my 350D crop frame DSLR at local camera shops and spending a near ridiculous amount of time reading through indispensable online reviews such as this one.  With the price for each being roughly the same, the decision came down to the 10-22's ultra-wide capability vs. the 17-40's build quality.I ended up choosing the 17-40 and here's why:-Incredible optics and sharpness.  If you're like me and have never owned an \"L\" series lens before, you'll be able to see the difference in optical construction quality before you ever snap a digital shot.  It's evident in the viewfinder just how precise this lens is.-Longevity: I'm the kind of guy who likes high quality equipment and can see myself upgrading to a full-frame sensor camera body sooner rather than later.-Wide vs. Ultra-wide: You'll often read warnings of the difficulty in framing sub-20mm ultra-wide compositions.  It's a valid point.  Only certain scenarios lend themselves to 180 degree framing but most of the time you'll be challenged to keep all of the uninteresting junk out of the frame.  I was a little worried about 17-40mm's 27-54mm conversion when used on a crop frame.  Would it be wide enough?  Answer, yes.  27mm is plenty wide for most applications and with the crop factor, I get almost zero barrel distortion at the widest edges.  In my estimation, the 10-22 is more of an effect lens whereas the 17-40 is much more of an everyday multi-purpose working lens.In summary, if the focal length range of the 17-40 doesn't overlap too much over your current lens kit and you favor high-quality wide over good quality ultra-wide, then this lens is right for you.*NOTE: If the 17-40's inclusion of a lens hood is influencing your decision in anyway over the 10-22, don't let it be.  The hood is basically a pain in the rear due to it's ridiculous size and shape.

The 40mm (64mm on the XTi) is a bit short, and I wish it were longer.  However, giiven that this lens costs only (did I say \"only?\" lol) about $650, I have no complaints about the lens.  Something's gotta give.  It's weight is nicely substantial (not too heavy), and since I use my XTi with a battery grip all of the time, the combined weight balances well in my hands. To me, the battery grip and this lens are perfect companions to make the XTi's complete. I like this 17-40mm f/4L USM Wide Angle Zoom Lens for my XTi.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This lens completes XTi (or 30D).", "unixReviewTime": 1180483200, "reviewTime": "05 30, 2007"}

I'd already purchased a 50mm/1.4, a 75-300mm USM IS, and the Rebel came with an 18-55mm. But I was missing a good, wide lens. After much hand-wringing and research, I settled on the 17-40mm piece of L-glass. I haven't regretted it.The 18-55mm EFS lens that comes with the Rebel is...ok. It falls out of focus easily and feels cheaply constructed. On the other hand, the 17-40mm lens is as solid as you can hope for - metal mounts, feels extremely well put together. Its not especially fast, but its quick enough. I've not missed a shot yet.I mostly use the 17-40mm for outdoor photowork and some indoor portrait work provided the lighting conditions are favorable, otherwise I use my 50mm/1.4. The 17-40mm is good walk-around lens. The addition of a lens-hood and a case is a nice bonus.Yes, the 10-22mm EF-S will get you an extra 7mm, something us digital SLR users would kill for given the 1.6x conversion. But again, the build quality difference between the 10-22 and the 17-40 is glaring. Not to mention that should you need to resell the 10-22 later, only 20D and Digital Rebel customers would apply, unless Canon expands the line-up of EFS-compatible cameras.And...this is L-glass. The pictures are impressive. The bokeh is pleasing.

Buy the 17-55/2.8 IS for a crop camera or a 16-35/2.8 II for full-frame if you can swing the cost.This 17-40/4L is light (475g) and small. Lighter than the 28-135/3.5-5.6 IS kit zoom, lighter than just about everything else in this class. Build quality is excellent with very tight tolerances. AF is fast, silent, and accurate. It takes standard-depth 77mm filters without vignetting, and if you attach one, it's weather-sealed. Nothing about the way it handles surprises in a negative way.Image quality on a crop body is excellent, though irrelevant and slightly inferior to the 17-55/2.8 IS in most ways. There's almost no reason to buy this lens for crop cameras (Rebels, 20D-60D, 7D). You gain marginally better extreme edge quality and weather sealing (that the body itself probably doesn't have) at the expense of IS and focal range.Image quality on full-frame can be very good. Center sharpness is fine at focal lengths and apertures from f/4 to f/16. Edge sharpness, defined as roughly the outer fifth of the frame, is weak at 40mm f/4 and blurry at 17mm f/4. This area is decent by f/8 and good by f/11, but doesn't quite rise to what you'd see with the Tokina 16-28/2.8. The far corners are never sharp at any aperture. There's noticeable lens flare with point light sources. Contrast is very good.For movie shooters, this lens is parfocal, so it doesn't require refocusing when you zoom. Use it with a Steadicam-style rig to reduce handshake.The 17-40 focal range is excellent for a walkaround. My favorite moderately-priced two-lens kit with my full-frame 5D II combines this (or the 16-35/2.8) and a 100/2. Before that, I had a 10-22 and 50/1.4 with a crop 40D. I missed the last millimeter of the 10-22 (a 16-35 equivalent); the lost width is noticeable. That lens also had better sharpness across the frame.Before I bought the 17-40, I went through alternatives in the same price range. Here's the full list with used prices and whatever issues I encountered:Sigma 17-35/2.8-4 (560g) ($300) (QC variance, poor wide open)Sigma 15-30/3.5-4.5 (615g) ($300) (QC variance, flare, poor edges)Sigma 12-24 I/4.5-5.6 (615g) ($475) (slow, not a walkaround, soft below f/8)Sigma 12-24 II/4.5-5.6 (670g) ($575) (slow, not a walkaround)Tokina 17-35/4 (600g) ($400) (no benefit over the 17-40/4L, softer)Tokina 16-28/2.8 (950g) ($625) (heavy, doesn't take filters)Tamron 17-35/2.8-4 (440g) ($400) (AF issues, soft)Canon 16-35/2.8 I (600g) ($850) (weak corners)Canon 17-35/2.8 (545g) ($650) (out of service, no close focus, very poor edges)Many of these lenses are older designs intended to compete with Canon's 17-35/2.8. Sigma's 17-35 and 15-30 are both cheap and capable, but subject to wide sample variance that you won't be able to mitigate if you're buying from third parties. The 15-30 is worth a look if you can try it out before you buy. The 12-24 series are so wildly different from the 17-40/4L that they're almost a different class of lens. Interesting, but special purpose.The most compelling alternatives are the 16-35/2.8L I and Tokina's 16-28/2.8. The Tokina has the best image quality of any ultra-wide zoom for any mount save Nikon's 14-24/2.8. You pay for it with over two pounds of weight, a bulbous front element that won't take filters, and a focal range that starts and ends wide. The 16-35/2.8L II has similar quality at equivalent apertures.Among new lenses, there's almost no reason to prefer the 17-40/4L over the 16-35/2.8 II save cost. The latter has better image quality at all focal lengths and apertures and less flare. Weight is marginally higher and it takes enormous 82mm filters. Otherwise, it's the preferred Canon full-frame ultrawide.Because I found f/4 wanting for general-purpose use indoors, I replaced my 17-40/4L with a 16-35/2.8L II. For landscape apertures, the two are almost indistinguishable. The Tokina 16-28/2.8 is sharper to the edges than both, but I wasn't willing to stomach the weight or lack of filters.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Almost perfect save for the borders on full-frame", "unixReviewTime": 1343520000, "reviewTime": "07 29, 2012"}

It is sharp (Oh baby is it!) and at 2.8,fast enough for just about any pro or serious amateur. But there were plenty of times I needed a little more coverage than the 28MM focal length provided. Since most of my work is with long-lens and fast (and expensive) zooms, I couldn't pony up the bucks for Canon's superwide f2.8 zoom. When I saw the price on the 17-40MM lens and the fact that it was the \"L\" flavor with pro glass, I bought it immediately.  I've had it for about a year and I have already sold several pictures - published in glossy magazines with picky photo editors. And I trust it to give me sharp pictures, even at the extreme settings - wide open and at the 17MM end. You have to remember to always use the weird looking but effective lens hood to control flare and as with any very wide lens, look at the edges of the frame (your feet could be in every picture!) It's light, good enough to use as your normal lens and with their new 70-300 IS DO lens could make for an amazing and compact travel kit. So while Canon's lens experts probably built this one for the growing digital crowd, as a film user I think it's the bargain of the year and is in my camera bag every time I go on assignment. I suggest that you get a good quality \"thin\" UV filter and polarizer and you will be set to explore the exciting world of ultra-wide photography.Important update: I recently returned from an assignment to Monte Carlo to test drive sports cars. Part of the deal was to get thrill rides from a pro driver up and down the French mountains above Monaco. Armed with my 17-40MM an EOS 1V, 540 flash, and Velvia 50, I clicked off a whole roll of film during my turn in the passenger's seat.

Canon makes each lens at every price point well-suited to various tasks, but with limitations that can only be overcome by graduating to the next higher priced but similar item.  A case in point: the wide-angle zooms.The 17-40mm f/4 is one of Canon's best deals in L-series glass.  You have to spend twice as much to get a lens of similar quality, but just one stop faster.  Does this make the more-expensive EF 16-35 f/2.8L a ripoff?  Not for its own specific use: the extra stop gives you the speed to shoot in more indoor situations.  Not all photographers need this.  When indoors, we're often taking pictures of people, which are better suited to lengths around 50-100mm.  To capture sweeping panoramas of parlors for Architectural Digest (or Coldwell Banker) the f/2.8 is the better lens and worth the step up in price, though in many cases you could use the f/4 lens with a tripod.  All this means is that the f/2.8 is priced for professional specialists whereas the f/4 is for more general use. My bigger point is that Canon has its whole lineup positioned: the differences across lenses are specific and appropriately priced, which is good news for the consumer.  It's hard to make a mistake buying homegrown Canon lenses, especially L-series lenses.  You just have to figure out which set of two or three suits your range of uses.The 17-40mm is a steal for people who need a walkaround lens for travel and outdoor photography.  The shorter focal lengths of the zoom are great on a digital body, with nice reach and minimal distortion; just an ability to grab up landscape and wide situations end-to-end, even when standing close.  The focal lengths around 40mm are tight enough for portraits and other local detail.  Colors are strong and convincing; contrast deep and impactful.  The lens itself is small enough and light enough to grab-and-go, but nicely machined, with solid fit and finish.  It has an instantly recognizable profile, with the added bonus of the red ring.This lens, plus a 70-200mm f/2.8 telescope and a nice fast fixed lens in the range betwixt are all you need.  On vacation, and in most outdoor situations, the 17-40mm alone suffices.

This lens is soft wide open at F/4 but sharpens up noticeably at F/4.5 and becomes a super wide angle take it all in landscape and interior monster when stopped down to F/9 on a Canon 5D Mark II. This is a lens I always carry with me now since I never know when I might see a wide angle opportunity. Doesn't have the you are there feeling when viewing the photos on my iMac as much as the Canon 85mm F/1.2 II L or Canon 100-400 IS L lenses but it's closer to perfection then you will ever see on a cropped sensor camera. I keep hoping that Canon will make a wide angle zoom that matches the performance of my Canon 100-400 IS L zoom lens.  The 24-70 F/2.8 seems pretty similar in performance as the 17-40 it's just faster and has more reach.  I normally prefer the 17-40 F/4 L over the 24-70 on the 5D Mark II unless I am shooting weddings and then I carry both with me.Pros:Very nice lens bag includedCenter is sharp even at F/4Love that high quality L Lens buildLens hood included and easy to installGreat contrast, beautiful rich color imagesSuper quiet and super fast USM auto focusGreat landscape lens super sharp at F/8 and 17mmGood walk around lens for cropped sensor camera, ultra wide lens when used on a full frame sensor camera.This lens has Auto Lens Vignetting correction using peripheral Illumination control see Auto Vignetting comments belowButtery smooth zoom and manual focus ringsFits all Canon EOS cameras including full frame film and 5DFirst copy I got was good to go with no quality control issuesSharper on the wide end 17 to 24mm then Canon EF-S 17-55 F/2.8 IS and Canon 24-70 F/2.8 L but much softer then them on the narrow end 40mm.Cons:Only F4, wish it was F2.8 or even F3.5Lens Hood is very bulky and hard to storeRather narrow 17-40 zoom range: 17-55 would have been nicerVery soft wide open in the corners, sharpens a lot at F/4.5Could be sharper on the corners on the narrow end 24mm to 40mm and wide openFirst impressions:If you are an older photographer like me you remember the good ole days when all SLR 35mm style lens had a quality feel to them.  Built to last forever with smooth zoom and focusing and they came with a lens hood and carrying bag.  Details included a built in lens focusing scale in both feet (green lettering) and meters (white lettering) and an infrared scale adjustment in red lettering.  The lens mounted to the camera body with a precision feel like the two were actually made by experienced craftsman who actually cared about the product they were creating.  It's a great quality feel that you can get used to.  With this Canon EF 17-40mm f/4L USM lens that's exactly what you are getting, a finally crafted functional work of art.I never cease to be amazed at USM auto focus, so quiet, so fast, so accurate, so useful with the auto-focus manual focus override without turning off the auto focus.  I shoot both wild life and weddings both of which require at times the camera be as quiet as possible up to the moment you shoot.  This lens delivers; I can barely hear it focus even with my ear against the lens and can not hear it focus at all only a couple of feet from the lens.Decisions Decisions:Like a lot of other people I was looking to upgrade my basic Kit 18-55 lens (very soft muddy lens) I got with my Canon Rebel XTi camera.  And like a lot of people I wanted a lens that I would never outgrow or tire of or wear out.  I take a lot of photos and frequently upgrade camera bodies and wanted a lens that will also work on a full frame camera like the 5D.I had borrowed a friends 17-70 Sigma and it was really sharp and for the money (less then half the price of the Canon 17-40) I thought I would try one even though it wouldn't work on a full frame camera.  I went through three copies and all were bad before deciding to go back to the 17-40.  Man what a great decision going with the Canon 17-40.  Thanks to 47th Street photo for being so nice about the whole return twice then later upgrade from Sigma to Canon situation.  I only had to pay return shipping.Testing:When I received my new Canon 17-40 I took it out, mounted it on my Canon Rebel XTi and mounted the camera on a tripod, put on a remote release, set the camera to mirror lockup mode, Aperture Propriety at F8,  28mm zoom and tested it both against my friends Sigma 17-70 and my own basic Canon 18-55 kit lens.  The 17-40 absolutely blew the kit lens out of the water: in sharpness, contrast and richness of color.  Then I tried it against the Sigma which I thought was a sharp lens and the Canon 17-40 was sharper and had more contrast then the Sigma.  Then I set it to 40mm and shot against my Canon 50mm F1.8 II lens which I thought was pretty sharp and it was better then it as well.  I then tried the lens in various conditions and settings and all extremes both indoors and out with and without flash.  I also own a Canon 70-200 F2.8 L and it's sharper then it as well at some settings.I was very pleased to find out that the very first copy of this lens right out of the box was sharp enough and auto focus was right on the money!Auto Vignetting peripheral illumination control:Canon has this super sweet Auto Lens Vignetting correction that works with this lens both in camera with JPEG's and in RAW using peripheral Illumination control in Canon Digital Photo Professional (DPP) when using newer Canon digital EOS cameras (Canon Rebel XSi, 40D, 5D Mark II etc.) . No more vignetting when shooting wide open!!! When shooting Raw open the file(s) in DPP and click on NR/Lens Lens Aberration Correction / Tune and click on Peripheral illumination. The cameras listed above have already picked up the amount of vignetting based on focusing distance, zoom setting and F stop from the lens and the camera has saved the information with the Raw file. You can then adjust the amount under Peripheral Illumination if you don't like the amount automatically suggested. If you shot JPEG then you get the auto amount. SWEET!!!Conclusion:If you want THE best wide angle L lens to use on both cropped and ultra wide for full sized sensor Canon EOS camera bodies this is it.  It's dual purpose capabilities both as a normal walk around zoom (27mm to 64mm) on cropped sensor cameras and ultra wide zoom (17mm to 40mm) on full sized sensors make it a very versatile lens you won't out grow.I am very pleased and heartily recommend the Canon EF 17-40mm f/4L USM Ultra Wide Angle Zoom Lens.12-4-2007 UpdateI love this lens more then ever and I use it here at work a lot.  Since I take photos usually tripod mounted with a small depth of field F-8 to F-11 and shoot a lot in the 17 - 28mm zoom range this lens really fits the bill when mounted on my Canon Rebel XTi.  I continue to be impressed with the sharp high contrast photos and the super fast auto focus.One note of warning, this lens sticks out especially without the lens hood on.  I have since taken to having a lens filter mounted on it (B & W 77mm UV (Ultra Violet) Haze Multi Coated (2C) Glass Filter #010) to protect it although it seems to really degrade the sharpness and to some extent the contrast colors of the image.  I'm hoping to find a filter that does not degrade the image at all and am doing tests at all the local camera stores to try and find one.  Will post here when I find a great filter as I would like to buy one for my Canon 70- 200 to protect it as well and since it's the same filter size I could even switch back and forth.  For now when I have the lens tripod mounted and want the best image quality I remove the filter and when I am just walking around I leave the filter in place.Filter Update 1-3-2008After much searching I found the perfect filter.  The Hoya Multi Coat HMC Pro1 Protection filter is not supposed to filter the shot just protect the front lens element.  I was very worried that it would affect the shot after having tried some other premium filters like the B+W UV which caused the photos to be softer and duller.  However, after some tests I found that in some weird way the Hoya Multi Coat HMC Pro1 actually makes the photos seem to have just a little more contrast and be a little sharper then without.  I thought I had gotten the test shots backwards and had to retest with a little sign in the photo saying with and without filter in place just to make sure.  Really amazing!!!  I'm sold!3-28-2008Well, it was one of the sharpest lens I own.  Now I have a different standard as it's been surpassed by the Canon EF-S 17-55 F/2.8 IS lens which is sharper at the narrow end 24-40mm at every equal setting and by my Canon 135mm F/2 L and Canon 85mm F/1.2 L II.  But I still love this lens and I am going to keep it and it is very sharp on the wide end 17mm even at F4.5.  I plan to use it for ultra wide angle when Canon finally releases their Canon 5D replacement whenever that is. I also still use it on my Canon 40D and Rebel XTi when I am in dusty areas because of the weather sealing.  And the zoom action is so smooth I wish the 17-55 F/2.8 had this zoom action.  Still the colors are bright and it's pretty sharp and its small and light!4-17-2008 UpdateI still love this lens and use it for motorcycle rides and hiking where it's light weight and weather tight seal come in handy.  Plus I found that you can get an image very sharp if you process it using the Canon Digital Photo Professional that came with you camera.  I also use as a backup at weddings and for out door wide angle wedding shots and landscapes.9-22-2008 Update:I'm getting ready to purchase or lease the new Canon 5D Mark II and boy oh boy is this 17-40 L lens going to come in handy.  One of the first places I want to take the happy couple is to the Grand Canyon.  17mm at F/10 tripod mounted oh YEAH!!!  True wide angle bliss!!!10-07-2008 Update:I recently had a question as to why I bought the Canon 17-40 F/4 L lens instead of the Canon EF-S 10-22mm lens.  All EF-S lenses only work on cropped sensor cameras (Rebels, 40D, 50D etc).  I have ordered a new 5D Mark II full frame sensor which can not use the EF-S 10-22mm lens.  A full frame sensor camera makes the 17-40 lens at 17mm as wide as the 10-22 zoom is when the 10-22 is set at 11mm.  So there is only a 1 mm advantage with the EF-S 10-22 on a cropped sensor camera vs the 17-40 on a full frame sensor camera.  And the 17-40 has a much wider zoom range about double in fact.So bottom line on the EF-S 10-22mm f/3.5-4.5 vs the EF 17-40mm F/4 L if you only plan on using a cropped sensor camera then the EF-S 10-22mm lens could be the right lens for you.  However, if you are planning on moving up to a full frame sensor camera like the 5D or 5D Mark II then you can use the 17-40 L lens now with your cropped sensor camera as a walk around lens (it just won't be as wide) and then when you get a full frame sensor camera you will have all the wide angle glory and still be able to use the lens on both cameras.  If you never plan on buying full frame and want super wide angle you should go with the EF-S 10-22mm f/3.5-4.5.10-17-2008 Update:I've noticed this lens is very SOFT in the corners wide open at F/4.0.  Which is OK if you are looking for that say when shooting a wedding but not good when shooting landscapes.  But sharpens up a lot in the corners by going to F/4.5 and is as sharp as it's going to get by around F/8 where it seems about as sharp as any zoom I have and is approaching the sharpness of a prime lens at 17mm.[...][...][...]", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Light and a pleasure to use", "unixReviewTime": 1194393600, "reviewTime": "11 7, 2007"}

I think the best next thing would be an IMAX type lens with the appropriate displays... but that is beyond the scope of us mere mortals.I use the lens for aerial photography and for taking pictures of my favorite subjects: airplanes. In Airventure 2007, at Oshkosh, WI, I didn't have this lens and I lost several very interesting pictures for the lack of it. I purchased it shortly thereafter. On a recent trip on a Cirrus SR22 with a friend, I took dramatic pictures of my pilot friend doing his preflight, and once in the cockpit, doing all his clearance and pre-flight chores. The pictures do do justice to the reality of the scene, even when you take a composition of the airplane panel with the view outside the cockpit on the same picture. Some Photoshop - Shadows and Highlights - is all that is needed to bring it all into the dynamic range of the photographic papers we use.This is my favorite lens because of its perspective, the reality view you get at the 17mm extreme. For my girlfriend, this is her favorite lens because it's the only L-lens I have that's below 1 pound!NOTE: The lens hood is almost useless. Be careful with flare of the sun hitting the lens or a filter. The circular polarizer introduces weird artifacts because of the wide angle - part of the sky will be dark, part will be bright... better not use a polarizer.The other lens I have, all L-glass from Canon:* 70-200mm f/2.8 L IS - for the best airshow pictures you can fathom! Extremely fast lens, it works with the Autofocus on the 5D in the sub-second range, letting you use it almost as a point and shoot. Your only concern is the framing, everything else is done by the camera + lens.* 24-70mm f/2.8 L - extremely fast, extremely sharp. Sharp as a tack! If you take portraits of women, you will need to use the \"heal brush\" in Photoshop a lot, this lens doesn't forgive any wrinkles, pimples, large pores on the skin. For night scene photography, just let the camera at ISO 800 and you can do without a flash, for indoors night photography, even in an extremely dim restaurant.* 2x Extender - OK this is not a lens but it's an accessory that makes my 70-200mm into a 140-400mm f/5.6. AWESOME! At Airventure it's used to take pictures of the planes at the extreme end of the runway getting ready for take off.

It takes beautiful pictures, sharp, beautifully saturated, with no discernable vignetting and little flare under normal circumstances.This lens has beautiful bokeh IMO and is every bit the equal, again IMO, of the 16-35 f2.8 L in every respect other than speed (f 2.8 vs f 4.0).  With the new digital SLR cameras you can easily make up for the loss of speed by cranking up the ISO.The construction quality is fantastic and it is a lens that you will be able to use forever.  It is an ideal lens for the current crop of 1.6 size sensors, but will also serve you well into the future whether you stick with the current size sensor or move up to larger sensors as they become more afordable.I heartily recommend this lens.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great walk-around lens!", "unixReviewTime": 1098403200, "reviewTime": "10 22, 2004"}

Hunter", "helpful": [505, 543], "reviewText": "(I really want to give this lens 3.5 stars)This review is written from the viewpoint of someone whom has used many L-class lenses, and as such will be a little harder on this piece of glass. If you've never used a Canon L lens and you purchase this one, I guarantee you'll be quite pleased with your purchase. But this review is really meant for those who own other L glass pieces and are looking into adding this one to their collection.The good:L glass tends to mean some heavy-weight glass, however this lens is surprisingly light and small. In fact, it is the smallest/lightest L zoom Canon makes. You find yourself more likely to take it to places where there may not be much of a projected photo opportunity or where there is a higher risk in damaged gear due to its unobtrusive size. It really is one of those few L lenses that you can casually walk around with and not garner much for attention.As with all L-glass, this ones very solidly constructed. It has a simplicity of design that minimizes risk to moving parts from shock. It is well-balanced and just feels like a tight glass package.The lens performs very well in color and contrast. Natural saturation is excellent, easily on par with the L expectation. The color and saturation of this lens sits somewhere between the 70-200mm f/2.8 IS and the 24-70mm f/2.8.I initially thought that the zoom range would be constraining (a mere 23mm of range?), but in reality the lens is fairly versatile. This especially true on a 1.6 FOVCF body (20D, 30D, 350D, 400D, etc), where the range is more like that of a normal zoom, at the cost of the super-wide advantage. The lens handles pretty much all composition tasks except those of a telephoto or 1.0x macro. You won't be disappointed in the zoom versatility.Price. This like, what, the second cheapest L lens available. For those whom are very accustomed to purchasing/collecting L lenses, anything under a thousand dollars really is considered on the cheap side. If this is your first L purchase, this lens or the 70-200mm F/4L are your places to start.Flare. There's practically none.Cons: (there's only one, but its a biggie)Sharpness. This is by far my biggest qualm, and what makes me frown a little at this lens for its L designation. It's nowhere near that of other lenses. One of the biggest uses for this lens is landscape photography, where objects appear very distant and sharpness becomes crucial. 24mm at f/4 on this lens is easily less sharp than 24mm at f/2.8 (!) on the 24-70 f/2.8L. And as a little investigation will reveal, this probelm is also somewhat appearant on the 16-35mm f/2.8L (although it seems less pronounced). 100% crop comparisons of this lens to other lenses such as the 180mm f/3.5L is simply a joke.Other:This lens utilizes slight movement of the front element, so it is advised by pretty much everyone that a UV filter be purchased (77mm filter size). I add to that by saying: buy only the Multi-coated from B+W or Hoya if you're shooting digital. Yes, they're usually somewhere around eighty bucks, but spending forty on something that will bring you ghosting/contrast woes is not worth it.The hood of this lens is hilarious. It's almost five inches wide and maybe an inch and a half tall. I simply don't use it (I can't geometrically see how it helps. I think it may be something of a feel-good-hood if you're not consiencious about flare.) The lens is less conspicuous without it and I really don't have a flare problem.ConclusionI'm really not satisfied with the sharpness issue. It seems at least somewhat appearant on almost all Canon's lenses below 35mm. (Except for the 24-70 and 24-105, which is odd). I think they're still working out their wide-angle formula. Appearantly, the new 17-55mm f/2.8 is supposed to be sharper than both the 17-40 and 16-35, so they are probably on the right track of improving the issue.In the end, if you've never used L glass and are considering this one, buy it. You will be very pleased, I assure you. But if you own a good deal of L glass, you may want to hold off from this one and wait for Canon to improve their optics. You may find yourself like me, using other L pieces and only using this one when I absolutely have to.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Only decent in comparison to other L's", "unixReviewTime": 1162252800, "reviewTime": "10 31, 2006"}

I am a travel photographer and I spend many hours out at night. Night photography taxes the limits of most any equipment from camera bodies to glass. You can see some of my work here - LensTraveler18.com. I have rented and owned approximately 20 of Canon's fast glass in mostly wide angle varieties including the new 17mm T/S and the 24 F1.4 mm lens too.Without hesitation, this lens will match in sharpness and contrast any lens in my bag as long as it's at F4.5 or greater. At F6.7 it's as near perfect as I have found. I do not hesitate to recommend it yet some people have experience softness at wide apertures.Addressing the sharpness issue: There are tolerances in all manufactured products. Scientific, precise products like high resolution camera sensors and the placement/alignment of that sensor and the rear lens element. Even 2 mm off is relatively serious in terms of tolerances. The reason I am mentioning this is because sometimes you get this lens and it appears to be \"soft\" but it's really at the other end of the tolerance scale when compared to the camera. When you get a lens that \"matches\" your camera body, the results are startling, as you can tell from the comments on this site. I went through 3 lenses before I \"accepted\" the 1st one I bought. Some vendors like Amazon and their affiliates are very cooperative in helping you match your camera to your new lens. When you get one, you are going to be very satisfied.

I was surprised to see that in many cases that the kit lens pictures were actually better.  On sharpness, the 18-55 had the edge in my controlled tests using same aperture, tripod and remote shutter release etc.  I was very excited to get this lens,  I checked on its arrival date about 10 times while it was in the mail to me.  But I run a procurement department for a Fortune 100 firm, so by nature I am coldly analytical.  Simply put, the tests on the 24-70 just don't show anything close to a $1200 difference.  This is confirmed by tests that others have done.  I am sending it back and will use my 18-55 for a walkaround lens and my Canon f1.4 50mm ($400) for those special pictures with a beautiful bokeh and/or low light shooting capability (which on both counts the f1.4 is far superior to the 24-70).  Other things I noticed as I worked with the 24-70 is that for a cropped body like my XSI, it is not too long on wide angle as some others had complained. However with my f1.4 50mm though this can be an issue.  As for professional photographers, I understand why they use it: the 24-70mm handles most types of shots for a wedding so no lens changes which means no lost picture opportunities in a fast moving wedding (this is very important to them, and rightfully so!), it provides a nice bokeh at f2.8, and it can shoot without a flash in some, but not nearly all, lower light situations.  So for me the trade-offs are some lens changes and some difficulty with the 50mm being too long on some shots due to the cropped body.  But on the plus side, I will get as sharp or even sharper pictures using the combination of lens (18-55mm and the f1.4 50mm),  and with the f1.4, far better low light shooting and the best bokeh available.  Don't be a lemming and buy this because it is an L lens and therefore expected to be far superior.  Also don't take seriously those who haven't done a true comparison between the two lenses as they are working off of assumptions not facts.  I also don't think that I have a \"bad copy\" as no one has posted a valid test with results that clearly shows how superior the 24-70 is.

The other lenses I use most frequently areCanon EF 70-200mm f/4L USM Telephoto Zoom Lens for Canon SLR CamerasandCanon EF 85mm f/1.8 USM Medium Telephoto Lens for Canon SLR Cameras.This lens is very sharp, and captures excellent colors, which I have come to expect from L-series lenses.  This lens is more than adequately weather sealed, so I can use it with confidence under circumstances where I would tend to hesitate with my other lenses.  After returning from a weekend at the beach, it was amazing to see how many airborne sand particles had been caught by the rubber weather sealing, almost like flies stuck to fly-paper.  I was able to use a compressed air can to blow the tiny sand particles away from the external rubber seals - particles that almost certainly would have penetrated most other lenses.I have heard that constant mounting and dismounting of lenses that have weather sealing around the bayonette mount, like this one does, can wear-out the weather seal.  For this reason I am trying to be cautious both about using a more gentle mounting/dismounting technique, and about trying to avoid frequently switching out lenses when possible.  The seal can be replaced, but at a cost.A quick word about this lens versus the 24-105mm f/4.  For me the choice was easy, because I have found I don't really use the Image Stabilization on other lenses I own.  I have a pretty steady hand, and for longer shutter speeds I use a tripod anyway.  But I do often go down to a f/2.8 aperture.  And I already have the over-70mm coverage with my 70-200mm lens, so for me this lens is a better match than the 24-105.One interesting thing to note is that unlike many zoom lenses, this lens actually extends outward as the distance is reduced.  This means that for wide-angle shots it is possible to get shadows when using a camera-mounted flash, even without the hood attached.  Shooting under ambient light is an alternative, but that means boosting-up the ISO and/or decreasing the shutter speed.  Of course this works much better with modern equipment than in the days of film cameras, but isn't always the best option.This minor annoyance aside, I love this lens and wouldn't trade it for any existing comparable lens.  It is heavier than most other wide-angle zooms, but not excessively so.  The 24-70mm range provides good coverage, and when paired with a 70-200mm or even the 70-300mm, you've got excellent coverage for almost all circumstances.The most important qualities in a lens for me are sharpness, color, and versatility, and this lens is right on the money.  The weather sealing is a huge bonus.  A valuable lens!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The right lens for me", "unixReviewTime": 1279238400, "reviewTime": "07 16, 2010"}

I am moving up from a Canon EF-S 17-85mm f/4-5.6 IS USM lens, which is the lens I bought with the body of my Xsi.  This is my first DSLR, and got into it about 6 months ago with the birth of my first child.  Since then I have been steadily getting better, fumbling my way into taking better pictures.  After six months of taking about 5,000 pictures, I am now confident I can take technically correct pictures ( I learn the hard way).  I decided I wanted to see what all the fuss was about with L lenses, also I wanted something with a constant aperture so I didn't have to mess with my settings every time I zoomed in or out.After looking over several options I chose the Canon EF 24-70mm.  Right out of the box, I knew I wasn't fooling around any more, the 24-70mm L Lens looks like it ate my EF-S 17-85mm.  Heavy.  But I am a big strong lad and don't mind......it is much harder to zoom back in by turning this lens, I assume because I am moving a lot more glass when I twist the ring.  Looks to be durable. Happy that it came with the lens hood, I didn't really want to buy another $40 piece of plastic like I did for the 17-85mm.  The lens bag it comes with is also appreciated but doesn't protect the lens much so I assume it just to keep your lens from getting dusty.As previously stated by more qualified people then myself, this lens produces some crisp images.  After taking the time to set the correct exposure and white balance, I took a few shots and was very pleased with the output.  I took the pictures indoors with no flash and at a high ISO, and the pictures were still, to my eye, great.  I also have a little anxiety after plunking down a chunk of my hard earned money, I want to feel like I got my money's worth. I am happy to say this is not a purchase I regret, thus far.Only downside to this lens is you can't hide with this thing,for  a normal zoom lens its BIG. it draws attention along with bad jokes about your need to compensate for other short comings.It's not cheap and it won't make you  a better photographer, but it might let you do more in less then favorable light.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Budding Enthusiast's POV", "unixReviewTime": 1230854400, "reviewTime": "01 2, 2009"}

Normally, these wouldn't warrant an update for a lens that is so obviously well-suited to these roles, but this lens literally saved the day. I was shooting a wedding in one of the most difficult type of circumstances - never seen the location before, had 15 minutes before the ceremony to scope things out, had no chance to get my basic flow figured out by watching a rehearsal and this place was an exposure nightmare - black tuxes, white dresses in a very poorly lit chapel.  I was shooting with a backup camera (50D - great camera, read my review, but it doesn't perform well enough at high ISO for me to trust it for a wedding shoot as I don't want any noise introduced into things.)  So I knew I was going to be limited to some extent in terms of the freedom I'd have to play with different F-stops - I was going to need to be wide open to shoot at an ISO that I trust on the 50D for weddings (no higher than 200 in my experience) and have a shutter speed that wouldn't give me motion blur during the proceedings.  Suffice it to say that I was more than pleased with how sharp things were at F2.8.  I don't know that I could have done the same thing - on this camera - with the 24-105.  That extra full stop down to 2.8 was absolutely critical.  On another note, aspiring wedding photographers would be well advised to make an initial investment in a 5D Mark II or something in the 1D lines if you really want the freedom to work at high ISO and not worry about image degrading noise.  I am ultra-picky about noise, so perhaps what I notice wouldn't bother some, but the investment will be worth it in the quality of your work.  40D and 50D are wonderful prosumer cameras (high level consumer/amateur, entry level professional), but the 5D and 1D series truly set themselves apart at higher ISOs.  50D is a perfect backup, or a great second camera if you want to throw a 70-200 or something ultra-wide on it and switch to that on the fly during the wedding.  This lens pays for itself again and again.Perhaps the most common agony-inducing lens choice that Canon L-series fans may run into is the choice between the 24-70 F2.8 and the 24-105 F4 IS.  People waiver back and forth between the benefits of the 2.8 aperture vs. the IS and extra reach of the 105. Some say there isn't a wrong choice because both lenses are both so good.  I have a slightly different take - both lenses are good, they are both phenomenal, but you CAN make the wrong choice here, depending on the kit you already have and what you need the lens for.First off - the IS vs. the F2.8.  The 24-105 has image stabilization - a definite plus in low light, handheld situations.  While IS is great for up to 3 stops of exposure to prevent camera shake, it isn't going to freeze motion.  To do that, you need shutter speed.  To get shutter speed in lower light situations, you need wide aperture (and you want QUALITY glass so things are sharp wide-open).  I am not knocking the 24-105 at all, but the way I see it the F2.8 outweighs the benefit of IS - it lets you go up to a shutter speeds where camera shake shouldn't be an issue (especially in the 24-70mm focal length range) and is pin sharp at that aperture.  And these shutter speeds let you freeze action - good if you want to capture a toast in lower light at a wedding or something (unless a bit of motion blur is desired, which can easily be obtained...but if you don't have the 2.8 to begin with, there is no adjustment you can make to compensate save for bumping your ISO up and introducing more noise).  So in the debate over the benefit of 2.8 on the 24-70 vs. IS on the 24-105, I think the nod goes to the 24-70.Next, the extra reach (to 105mm on a full frame or 168mm equivalent on an APS-C like the 40D, 50D, Rebels).  In this case, you might think about the lenses you've got or that you plan to purchase.  For example, the 70-200mm zooms that Canon makes in its L-series are INCREDIBLY popular lenses, for good reason.  Whether you have the 70-200 F2.8 with or without IS or the 70-200 F4 with our without IS, you have yourself an excellent piece of glass with those mid-range zooms.  If you have one, or if you are planning on getting one, the 24-70 becomes the perfect compliment to them, giving you L-series performance from 24-200mm - if you have the 70-200 F2.8 you've got the ability to shoot at that wide aperture from 24-200mm - a very, very useful ability to have.  Granted, the 24-105 saves you from having to switch lenses if you are in the 70-105mm range, but I don't know if that is too much of an inconvenience.  I will say this, if you EVER plan on owning the 70-200 F2.8, you owe it to yourself to get the 24-70 F2.8 now.  Remember, F/2.8 is a full stop ahead of F/4 in light gathering capability, so if you are somewhat new to all of this, you will collect double the light at F2.8 than you will at F4 - meaning you could shoot at twice the shutter speed and get the same exposure as you would at F4 with a given shutter speed. I know many pro's that look at aperture as being the #1 priority with any lens purchase, always get as much of it as possible.  So, if you have any plans of ever owning one of the very popular 70-200mm mid range zooms from Canon, I think the 24-70 is the better choice.Now let's discuss image quality.  In this case, there is no loser.  The F2.8 lets you get shallower DOF. I've read some reports saying the 24-70 is sharper across more focal lengths and apertures and others that say the opposite, but when you are comparing the sharpness of these two lenses you are really splitting hairs.  My 24-70 is PIN SHARP at F2.8 - so sharp that I was literally stunned when I took my first test shots of the kids playing in the yard in the early evening.  Motion was frozen perfectly and details all the way down to their eyes were extremely sharp - there is no way I could have done this and gotten the results I did with anything but the freedom I had to shoot at 2.8 with a higher shutter speed in the evening light.  Sure, I could have shot at F4 with double the ISO and managed to keep the same shutter speed, but as I said before, the noise factor creeps in (to be fair, higher end Canon's do a great job with high ISO and noise).  But in cases where the need for the extra aperture isn't an issue, both of these lenses are superb.  You can't go wrong with either as far as image quality goes.Based on all this, it probably sounds like I'd never recommend the 24-105 over the 24-70.  But I would.  If you are planning on owning only one L-series lens (financially this is a very real issue for most of us) and want the ULTIMATE is high quality walkaround lens - a lens that will let you do professional quality work and has the added benefit of image stabilization, then I'd say go with the 24-105.  If, however, you plan on owning the aforementioned mid-range zooms and plan on doing things like event photography in poorly lit indoor settings, I think the 24-70 is the way to go.One more thing, if you get either of these lenses, don't plan on putting anything less than a high quality filter on them.  L-series lenses need very high quality filters or you are going to suffer degradation in image quality.  Spend the extra $80-100 (or more) and get a nice B+W UV filter.Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions about this lens or if there is some aspect of the decision between these lenses you didn't see here that you are interested in.2ND UPDATE - June 29: After borrowing one off and on for several months, I have also added an 85mm F1.8 to my collection (look for my review on it if you want the details).  Because I know that some people may be reading this review in the hopes of deciding on a good lens for portrait photography, I wanted to quickly reference this other lens as an option. First, the 24-70 F2.8L continues to prove itself a great investment.  It is a true workhorse lens for wedding photography, giving you a very useful combination of zoom and width, nice shallow depth of field with great sharpness at F2.8, and phenomenal build quality (after shooting an outdoor wedding in the pouring rain I really came to appreciate the rubber seal this lens has around the rear element where the lens connects to the camera.) So while I am obviously still a big proponent of the 24-70 as a portrait and general purpose lens, I have to mention that if you are really stressing out about the cost of this lens, you might seriously consider the Canon 85mm F1.8.  For around $380, this lens provides you with AMAZING portrait opportunities, incredible shallow depth of field with great sharpness at the focal points and silky smooth bokeh in the background. So, if a portrait lens is what you are looking for and the cost of L-series glass is an issue, consider the 85.  Obviously it is not as versatile as the 24-70 and there are some additional optical characteristics that make L series glass a bit better than non-L series glass, but the 85 F1.8 could be used for a professional portrait shoot without any concern at all.  Best of both worlds - get the 85 AND the 24-70! :) Email me if you have any questions about this lens or equipment in general and I'll help if I can.

This lens has been a favorite of many since it replaced its well-regarded predecessor, the 28-70mm.  It shoots images that are very sharp and have excellent contrast and saturation.  It's sharp wide open and only gets better when stopping down.  The USM (Ultrasonic Motor) focuses very fast, and full-time manual focusing is allowed.  I've thought about buying a 50mm f/1.4, but the results from this lens are so good, I'm having a hard time justifying the purchase.  I've been nothing but pleased with the pictures I get from the 24-70mm.  The constant f/2.8 aperture is great for shooting indoors and produces a very nice bokeh (background blur) when shooting portraits.  This lens is much heavier than comparable consumer-grade zooms, but I don't object to the weight.  I actually like the heft and feel of this lens on my 20D.  The only feature I wish it had is IS (image stabilization).The one thing preventing an unqualified recommendation is the recent release of the Canon 24-105mm f/4.0L IS.  The latter lens costs about the same and has some noteworthy advantages.  It is .7\" shorter, .2mm narrower and .6 lbs. lighter.  It has 3rd generation IS that gives you a 3-stop shutter speed advantage when shooting handheld.  I know from my 70-200mm f/2.8L IS that image stabilization is a very welcome feature when shooting handheld at slow shutter speeds.  And, obviously, the 24-105mm adds an extra 35mm of focal length on the long end.The 24-70mm bests the 24-105mm in one way: It's a faster lens.  That translates into the following advantages: At f/4.0, the 24-105mm cannot stop subject motion blur as well in low-light situations where the 24-70mm's f/2.8 can give you a shutter speed that is twice as fast.  Note that IS does not have any impact at all on subject motion blur, only on camera shake on your end.  If bokeh (background blur) is important to you, the 24-70mm will have a slight advantage over the 24-105mm given its wider aperture.  A wider aperture also helps a camera focus a little better in low light.The first run of the 24-105mm had a flare problem (see Canon's Web site for more info), and the early production models have been recalled.  But the problem has now been fixed.  You'll have to consider your photography priorities when deciding which of these two excellent lenses best suits your needs.  You would be well served by either.Update 2-12-12: It's been over six years since I wrote this review, and I continue to use and enjoy my 24-70mm, which is now paired with a Canon 7D.  Anyone considering buying this lens today, however, should know that Canon announced on 2-7-12 the successor to this lens: The 24-70mm f/2.8L II.

Maybe because of my technical background I started testing my own lenses quite a while ago. I have a (no longer so) little test lab of my own where I do 6 different image quality tests (after taking a lens out for a while).The EF 24-70mm f/2.8L USM is considered THE standard general purpose lens for professional use. I hardly know any (Canon) wedding photographer that doesn't own one (or hasn't owned one). It's solidly built, features a rugged metal lens mount and comes with a weather seal that allows shooting in (light) rain. It's a heavy (909 g / 32 oz) and bulky piece of equipment and the lens hood Canon supply with the lens is of massive size as well. But that's all for a good reason because the lens offers a great maximum aperture of f/2.8 throughout its focal range. This allows for narrow in-focus ranges (\"depth-of-field\") that give your images a nice look and it also enables shooting in low light conditions with fairly fast shutter speeds. Of course the lens also needs faster shutter speeds because it lacks an image stabilizer.The EF 24-70mm f/2.8L USM is equipped with a modern, fast, acurate and silent ring-type ultra sound focus motor. In the higher end Canon cameras the lens's maximum aperture enables additional focus sensors which enhance the accuracy of the focus further.The resolution of the EF 24-70mm f/2.8L USM is quite good for longer focal lengths but - to be honest - a little disappointing for 24 mm (which I use often with this lens). The cheaperEF 24-105mm f/4L IS USMis sharper at this focal length! On the other hand distortion is very well under control with the EF 24-70mm f/2.8L USM (for a zoom lens) and corner shadow / vignetting (though very intense at the wide angle) is pretty good at most focal lengths. But curvature of the focal plane (\"field curvature\") is a real issue with this lens. If you are shooting a straight subject like a group of people in a line-up and want everybody to be in perfect focus you will have to use high f-stops or avoid the wide end of the focal range. Whether this bothers you in real life photography really depends on what you are doing.Color fringes (\"chromatic abberrations\") both in focused (\"transverse CA\") and in out-of-focus (\"axial CA\") parts of the image are visible as well but they are not very intense. On the good side the circular aperture shape produces nicely even out-of-focus blur. Overall I would say that there are quite a couple of issues with the image quality of this lens and it seems like many of them have been addressed in the successor (the EF 24-70mm f/2.8L II USM) which - at the time of this review - had been announced but not released.I doubt that the good reputation of the EF 24-70mm f/2.8L USM comes from its image quality. If you are a pro you just need the fastest available lenses (and you usually can afford them) and for photo journalism or wedding photography image quality is really not all that important (in my opinion). But if you don't need f/2.8 you should take a close look at theEF 24-105mm f/4L IS USMwhich is cheaper, lighter, smaller, has an image stabilizer, a better zoom range and outperforms the EF 24-70mm f/2.8L USM in some of the image quality tests. But of course it's just not an f/2.8 lens.I have used both for several years and I still switch back and forth. I wouldn't recommend either of them for use with an APS-C camera though because the resulting effective focal range is just not as useful. Check out theEF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS USMand theEF-S 15-85mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USMif you are not shooting full frame.There are good reasons for buying the EF 24-70mm f/2.8L USM but whether it's the right lens for you really depends on what you are doing and on what's most important to you.A much more detailed review of this lens together with all test shots, sample images and technical data is available on my website LensTests_com.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Does the image quality reflect its good reputation?", "unixReviewTime": 1336521600, "reviewTime": "05 9, 2012"}

I will be using it when my daughter is photographing a wedding with me and she will be using the EF-S lens and myself the 24-70mm on my Canon 5D Mark II.  I performed some tests back to back and both lens are amazingly sharp at normal distances.  Plus it's a good compliment to the other lens because of a slightly different reach.  I also found the 24-70 to be better at macro photography as it can blow the subject up larger and seems sharper at very closes ranges.  And the 24-70 seemed to have a little better contrast and colors.  The 24-70 is much heavier then the EF-S and does not have IS.  But it does have a little more reach and is weather sealed.I was disappointed that my copy of the 24-70 has the same poor grabby zoom feel as the EF-S lens. All my other Canon L zooms have buttery smooth zoom action especially my 17-40 F/4 L.  The 24-70 is sharper then the 17-40 F4 L on the long end at 40mm but surprise of surprises the 17-40 is sharper then the 24-70 at 24mm towards the wide end.  But Surprise after sending my 24-70 in for repairs the zoom is much better and it's actually sharper then the 17-40 at all settings now.Also the long length of this lens blocks the built in flash for 40D and Rebels in bottom part of photos.  This should not be a problem for most people in this budget range as the cost of a Canon Speedlite is not that high and completely solves the problem.Bottom line though is the color, saturation and sharpness of this lens are simply second to none in the Canon  wide angle zoom arena.Pros:Very sharp stopped downWeather sealedGreat lens hood includedGreat colors and contrastGreat USM super fast auto focusThat little red ring around the end of the lens!Length does not change when zoomed if lens hood is mountedThis lens has Auto Lens Vignetting correction using peripheral Illumination control see Auto Vignetting comments below:Cons:CostSizeHeavyRepair prone, the most likely to need repair lens I have (see below)Very soft wide open (sent back to Canon for Calibration and they fixed it see update 10-6-2008 below)Wide angle a little narrow on cropped sensor camerasBlocks built in flash for 40D and Rebels in bottom part of photosZoom action was poor and grabby when new but later went smooth after a few hundred photosWould be nice if it had Image Stabilization IS (Canon does not have a single IS wide angle L lens)8-6-08 UpdateI find myself mainly using this lens during weddings when my daughter is using my Canon EF-S 17-55 F/2.8 IS lens.  Over the zoom range the 17-55 is sharper and the contrast is very similar but the big difference is the 17-55 has Image Stablization (IS)  and is much lighter and can go much wider when needed.  The IS makes a huge difference in a very dark location like inside a church lit by candle light when you may already be at 3200 ISO just to get the shot.  There are times I can use the extra reach of the 24-70 but more and more if I am free to move about and approach the bride and groom during the ceremony this makes the extra reach of the 24-70 unncessary.  Still I am keeping the 24-70 for use on a full frame camera like the new 6D whenever it comes out.For the most part the EF-S 17-55 IS F/2.8 is THE lens I have on my 40D most of the time.  If I wasn't shooting weddings and wasn't going to be adding a full frame camera to my arsnel I would suggest buying just the 17-55 IS F/2.8 and not the 24-70 at all.9-12-2008 Update Canon EF-S 17-55 F/2.8 IS vs Canon 24-70 F/2.8 L:I am taking photos tonight of a stage special and again will need to use both my Canon 17-55 F/2.8 IS lens and my Canon 24-70 F/2.8 L lens since my daughter and I will be shooting at the same time.  I can't help comparing the two again.  The 17-55 feels much lighter but at the same time feels so much cheaper in the hand between the cheap plastic feel the grabbing in the center of the zoom and the plastic build.  The 24-70 feels like a heavy quality jewel that will last two life times or more and it's weather sealed.  Still if you have to carry the 24-70 around for a few hours you wish for the lighter weight of the 17-55. The 17-55 has a wider view but the 24-70 has more reach.  The 17-55 seems sharper throughout the range but seems to have just a little less contrast and slightly cooler colors then the 24-70.  The zoom on my 24-70 is now almost broken in and feels smooth as silk and totally professional the 17-55 zoom feels like a cheap plastic toy and when you zoom even with a lens hood the front of the lens moves in and out. The 24-70 length does not change as long as you have the lens hood mounted.  The 17-55 has image stabilization and the 24-70 does not so I end up using a monopod for most dark shots with the 24-70.  The 17-55 is an EF-S and will not fit a full frame camera, the 24-70 will.  I'm thinking forward to the future  when I will be adding a full frame Canon camera body to my collection and I think the 24-70 will be perfect on that camera.9-16-2008 Update:After comparing photos to my friends taken wide open at F/2.8 I'm seeing a problem with the photos being much softer then his.  We both have Canon 40D's and so I have to wonder if there is a back focus or front focus problem.  I am going to send in to Canon and see what they say.Auto Vignetting peripheral illumination control:Canon has this super sweet Auto Lens Vignetting correction that works with this lens both in camera with JPEG's and in RAW using peripheral Illumination control in Canon Digital Photo Professional (DPP) when using newer Canon digital EOS cameras (Canon Rebel XSi, 40D, 5D Mark II etc.) . No more vignetting when shooting wide open!!! When shooting Raw open the file(s) in DPP and click on NR/Lens Lens Aberration Correction / Tune and click on Peripheral illumination. The cameras listed above have already picked up the amount of vignetting based on focusing distance, zoom setting and F stop from the lens and the camera has saved the information with the Raw file. You can then adjust the amount under Peripheral Illumination if you don't like the amount automatically suggested. If you shot JPEG then you get the auto amount. SWEET!!!Conclusion:  In the end I will just have to keep both of them.Update 10-6-2008:I got my Canon 24-70mm F/2.8 L lens back from the Canon repair facility and it is tack sharp at F/2.8 at all zoom settings close up and tack sharp from 35mm to 70mm out near infinity.  It's still a little soft at 24mm at F/2.8 near infinity but much better then it was.The zoom feels much better.I'm a very happy camper!!!Here's what they said was wrong with it.\"We have examined the lens according to your request, and it was found that the adjustment of the pcb assembly was incorrect the image was blurred.  Electrical adjustments were carried out on the pcb assembly.  Other electrical adjustments, inspection and cleaning and mechanical adjustments were carried out.01-01-2009 Update:Vignetting:I have noticed on the full framed 5D Mark II my Canon 24-70 F/2.8 L lens with the peripheral illumination correction turned OFF the 5D Mark II images will severely vignette or be dark in the corners when shot wide open (F/2.8).  It's almost like looking through a dark tunnel.  It's especially noticeable shot wide open with the sky as a background.Canon Auto-correct to the rescue!!  With the peripheral illumination correction turned ON it's almost magical the darkening in the corners for your JPEG images is gone!  If you want you can even shoot in Raw mode and adjust the amount of Vignetting or darkness in the corners for effects such as when shooting portraits and you want to emphasis the person in the middle of the photo.  Just open the Raw photo in DPP and click on the NR/Lens / ALO tab and select Lens Aberration Correction Tune and adjust the peripheral illumination to suite by dragging the slider or entering and amount.  Or select all the photos in a directory and you can correct all your photos at once.  This way you can either have no Vignetting or as much as you want.01-03-2009 Canon 5D Mark II Update:The 24-70 F/2.8 is great on the 5D Mark II like the 17-40 L and has better reach then the 17-40. But it does not have that uncanny you are there feel of photos taken with the Canon 100-400 IS L zoom lens. Thank GOD for the auto peripheral as this lens is a Vignetting monster when shot wide open on a 5D Mark II, it was not on the 40D. With the Vignetting control built into Digital Photo Professional (DPP) and the on-board 5D Mark II auto control it's perfect and Vignetting is not a problem. This lens is fragile and has required sending back to Canon for recalibration but is a must have in my arsenal. I'm hoping Canon will come out with an Image Stabilized improved version that has that you are there feel of the 100-400 zoom.3-18-2009 Update\":After getting this lens back from Canon repair it's turned into a better lens mounted on my Canon 5D Mark II at times approaching the look my Canon 17-40 F/4 L.  It's sharp at F/2.8 but then softer until about F/4 for some reason but that's fine as I either shoot wide open or stopped down to F/5.6 or so.  I'm much happier with it now after repair and the zoom action is smoother as well.  Still I'm worried that it may need repairs again.  I have other lenses I have even dropped onto the floor that are still flawless!!4-5-2009 Update:If I could shoot all day with the Canon 85mm F/1.2 II L I would.  The Canon 5D Mark II clearly out resolves the Canon 24-70 F/2.8 L lens and that is very disappointing for a lens that costs over a thousand dollars. But at a wedding where you can't always zoom with your feet I reach for the Canon 24-70 F/2.8 L. Its good on the 5D Mark II but not as good as the 17-40 L but it has better reach then the 17-40. It also does not have that uncanny you are there feel of the 85mm F/1.2 II L or even my Canon 17-40 F/4 L zoom.  Thank GOD for the auto peripheral as this lens is a Vignetting monster when shot wide open on a 5D Mark II, it was not on the 40D. With the Vignetting control built into Digital Photo Professional (DPP) and the on-board 5D Mark II auto control it's perfect and Vignetting is not a problem. This lens is also very fragile and has required sending back to Canon for recalibration but is a must have in my arsenal only because I do weddings. I'm hoping Canon will come out with an Image Stabilized improved version that has that you are there feel of the 100-400 zoom.  Once again it seems like this lens may be losing it's calibration and I am starting to lose my patience.  If I could I would change the rating to 3 stars!!!4-25-2009 Update:This lens is for sure going out of calibration again.  To say I'm ticked off is an understatement!  When you pay over a thousand dollars for an L lens you expect better.  No other Canon lens I own has gone out of calibration or had to be sent back for repairs.  I can hardly wait for the replacement lens to come out and I will try and get what I can out of this lens on e-bay.4-27-2009 I just got back from photographing the World Premiere of X-Men Origins: Wolverine and once again the 5D Mark II was awesome.

So far, I've kept it on the 5D and can't bring myself to take it off.I considered a couple of lenses, including the IS 24-105 f/4 which has a lot of appeal and the price is about the same. But this was the lens I chose in part because I already have a the 70-300mm f/4.5-5.6 DO IS Lens and the overlap seemed a waste while the extra stop helps.  I have no regrets about it. sharp as a tack and quick.I note that this is not compact lens, especially with the hood on and it can stretch out a lot when you widen the field. It is also not light. This lens and the 5D will give your neck and back a pain, assuming you work with more than one camera. But the focal lengths covered are just about ideal and require none of the compromises that a longer zoom range require. For that, I've got an 18-200 on a 20D. The 70-300 DO, while not an L, specs out in that range and has the virtue of real compactness, but it' not a lightweight. These two lenses cover just about everything for me. And I can keep the 10-22mm on the 20D for the extra-wide shots.Since writing the initial review, I've since traveled for several weeks with this lens and it fully lived up to expectations. Given the difficulties of travel these days, I am concerned about the problem of not being able to carry it with me -- not a problem to date except for Britain. But always possible. And, despite the weight, I might favor the 70-200 F/2.8L IS USM as a second travel lens- I like the brightness of the focus.One suggestion. There's a temptation to use this lens wide open a lot of the time. It's very good and sometimes that's the best thing.

Before I get to all of the reasons I love this lens and would recommend it so highly, I am going to point out the one issue I have with it - purple fringing (I usually classify this particular type of chromatic aberration as its own beast, but I guess it falls into the overall category of CA.)  This lens produces some strong purple fringing in borders of two sharply contrasting areas.  I don't want this review to be a lesson on CA or purple fringing, so I'll just leave it at that - the lens has issues with it.  I've read that this is an issue with many primes. The fringing can be addressed in post processing via Lightroom and Photoshop, but all things considered I'd rather not have to add that to my workflow.  Oh well.  With the type of shooting I do, I honestly don't have to deal with issues arising from this that often, but I want to give a complete review of this lens, positives and negatives.  And that is the only negative.Now, on to the positives -1) Build Quality - This lens is very solid.  Doesn't feel like a brick the way my 24-70 F2.8L does, but its a solid lens all around.  Canon L-series lenses are always built well.  A LOT Of glass in this lens.  You might want to invest in a very high quality UV filter if you are at all worried about scratches to this beautiful glass.  But if you do, don't skimp on the UV filter - go with a nice B+H or something.2) Image Quality - Phenomenal.  My copy of the lens is tack sharp wide open at F1.4.  Ridiculously shallow depth of field at that aperture that allows you to set your subject apart from the background even when you are shooting at a bit of distance from them.  If you are shooting up close with this lens at F1.4 you need to be really aware of the shallow DOF because you can end up with things like one eye out of focus if a person's head is turned ever so slightly so that one is further from you than another.  This is Photography 101 type stuff, but with more and more newcomers to photography picking up DSLRs and investing in L-series glass, I figured I'd point that out - be aware of what aperture is going to get you the DOF you want - don't just shoot wide open all the time without thinking a bit about what the practical implications of this are!  This is a great storytelling lens on a full frame camera - wide enough to capture moments by letting you place your subject meaningfully in their surroundings in the frame.  At the same time, you can move up close and get some stunning shots that way as well.  I wouldn't choose this lens over a 50 or an 85 to shoot formal portraits/headshots with, but if you are planning on leaving this lens on the camera much of the time (something I find myself doing often) know that you can shoot up close without a ton of distracting distortion that can be an issue when shooting with a wide angle lens.  My point is that this lens can be a very versatile lens, especially on a full frame camera (I only use it on my 5D Mark II - I don't use it on my 1D Mark IV because I want the width this lens gives me at the full frame end of things moreso than any additional zoom I'd get from the 1.3x crop I get on the mark IV).  Colors are vivid and very well reproduced with the lens and it gives you beautifully smooth bokeh.  That smooth bokeh is accentuated by the sharpness of the lens from wide open to the end of its aperture range.3) Usefulness - Despite being prime lens on the wider end, this lens is very versatile.  As I mentioned, I routinely leave this on my 5DII for long periods of time.  It's also great for personal use, shooting birthdays, reunions, etc.  The width on full frame allows you to capture storytelling moments with wider compositions.  Moving in close to your subject allows you to fill the frame with a single person, face, etc., and with the shallow depth of field you can get some very interesting images in this way - eyes in focus, ears out of focus, etc.  In that way, it could be looked at as a good walkaround lens if you aren't in the need of zoom capability.  If its a zooming walkaround lens you are looking for, consider the 24-70 or the 24-105 (I wrote a long review on the 24-70 vs. the 24-105).4) Price - It's not cheap, but I'm not regretting the purchase in the least.  It has become my most frequently used lens for both business and personal shooting.  I'm finding myself more and more drawn to the primes, and will probably be adding the 135 F2 to my collection next.Highly recommended!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "An Amazing Lens - Especially on Full Frame...but watch for purple fringing", "unixReviewTime": 1310774400, "reviewTime": "07 16, 2011"}

So, you have to be careful with type of model you are using.It is also very useful for low available light situation, so I see some wedding photographer used them.Some of events photographer also love to use this for similar reason, and it seemed to work well with capturing child etc.However, I only see limited satisfied amateur user of this lens... while I am teaching photography lesson.It is may be because it makes very little economic sense for amateur user who are shooting landscape or family portrait.This 35mm lens focal length are well covered by many reputable L zoom lens including 16-35, 17-40, 24-105, 24-70 and other. All of them are excellent L lens, and will do wonder for the most of landscape or portrait project.  Zoom lens actually makes better economic argument in many occasion.As far as difference from L zoom lens concern, you won't notice much until you started to enlarge to considerable size.To be honest, not all of my 35mm focal length shoot on commercial assignment used this prime lens either... and that is even for the people who shoot staged subject in studio.

Why wait.You really have to look at its performance when it is stop down to f2.8~f4 where many of money shot using this lens are created.For people who are not sure about taking plunge to the L prime lens, I strongly suggest to rent this lens for a week or more, so you will be sure you needed this lens for your particular style.Major Advantage are:1. F1.4 Aperture really help for low available light portrait situation, and ideal for indoor use.2. Very nice portrait lens for particular type of production.3. Work wonderfully on both full size sensor camera as well as 1.6x body.4. Build quality is excellent5. Very sharp, sharp enough to convince you that your L lens prime is worth the price.  Very useful for spread or any other large assignment.Major Disadvantage are:1.Cost as much as L zoom lens that does not sit well for many people.2.Prime lens is inherently limited as a workaround lens, so I wold go for L zoom lens if I have to choose lens on the travel.3.35mm is not going to work well with particular type of people as head portrait lens, so if you are going to buy your first L prime lens for portrait purpose, it is might be safer to buy 50/f1.2 or 85/f1.2", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "My favorite L Prime Lens", "unixReviewTime": 1250294400, "reviewTime": "08 15, 2009"}

I use this lens as my standard lens on a 5d. I find this angle of view to be perfect for general all around photography where I will \"step in\" to the subject to get the shot. This lens requires more interaction with the subject, but I think it results in more dynamic pictures. This lens is razor sharp, visibly sharper than my mainstay 24-70 f2.8 L zoom. On the 5d, I can shoot at f1.4 ISO 400 indoors without a flash which is pretty cool.Now the downside. All wide angles at wide open aperture have light falloff and even this lens demonstrates this tendency. You may not even notice this on many shots, but under some conditions it is very obvious and this condition is more noticeable on digital than film. You can fix this using the distortion filter in PhotoshopCS. If you shoot at f4 or better, the light falloff is not noticeable even under the worse of conditions. The falloff is not visible when you use this lens on an APS digital sensor like the 20d where it has a \"normal\" angle of view.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Razor sharp and fast, but shows light falloff.", "unixReviewTime": 1138406400, "reviewTime": "01 28, 2006"}

It shines at capturing a very natural perspective with unique clarity and bokeh.  I own both the 50/1.2L and 24/1.4L II and have had the chance to use a friend's 35L for a couple weeks.  It really seems to shine at capturing groups of people in natural environments.  It has just enough of a wide angle perspective to feel natural while at the same time providing sufficient subject isolation through it's fast aperture.  The subject isolation of the 50/1.2 is much greater while that of the 24/1.4 is much less.It is generally a bit wide for single person portraits, but is excellent for two person portraits or smaller group shots.  This lens pairs very well with a fast 85mm lens.  The 35/85/135 L primes are referred to as the \"holy trinity\" in Canon circles due to the excellent spacing of focal lengths and the unique rendering characteristics of each lens.Technically this lens is about on par with the 24/1.4II maybe slightly better than the 50/1.2L.  All lenses are sharp near the center of the frame, but this lens seems to hold onto its sharpness towards the edges a little better than the other two at large apertures.  Stopped down they are all excellent across the frame.  The bokeh of this lens has a bit more character than the stronger, more uniform bokeh of 50mm and 85mm lenses.  Images from the 35L seems very atmospheric compared to longer, more isolating focal lengths.I have found focusing on my 5DII bodies to be fast, smooth, and very accurate.  The lens is generally built very well, but still sports the smooth plastic finish of older L lenses.  The updated finish of my 24/1.4 II is more substantial and feels far better in-hand.  I'm half expecting Canon to come out with a version II soon with a host of updates, including the newer textured finish.  The lens hood fits nicely and does its job - which is primarily to protect the front element since this lens flares very little.My #1 advice to people looking to purchase an L prime in this range is to buy for the focal length you want.  Having owned or used most all of the short L primes I can tell you confidently they are all the best lenses you can buy in their respective focal lengths.  The only real difference among them is the focal length.  The perspective, rendering, and general \"feel\" of the images from each of the L primes is going to be different and special.  Buy the lens which suits your style the best instead of which one is perceived to be \"sharper\".As it stands, this lens is a wedding and photojournalistic juggernaut and by far the best 35mm lens you can buy for Canon.  Some would even argue that it's also better than all of the Canon 50s, but that's another debate.  Even if Canon does replace this lens soon, it will still be a heck of a good lens at this price.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "One of Canon's best primes", "unixReviewTime": 1318464000, "reviewTime": "10 13, 2011"}

I believe this lens is a member of that elite few. It is professional looking and artistic looking at once. Easily controllable; automatically just the right amount and character in every shot. Just purely brilliant bokeh. I also own the 135mm f/2L which also receives high praise for its bokeh but in my opinion it is not as good as this lens. More bokeh doesn't necessarily mean best bokeh. It is the quality of the bokeh. This lens truly possesses that special quality. Alright, enough about the bokeh.Sharpness? Of course it is razor sharp. It better be for this price.

I like to take pictures without the flash when ever possible, so I found that I was most often using it zoomed all of the way and I was always having to take a bunch of pictures just hoping that I could catch 1 or 2 when she was not moving so they would not be blurry.  I was initially looking for a faster zoom lens but since I was taking so many pictures zoomed out, I decided to give a fast prime lens a try.  So I decided to buy the 35 f1.4 in hopes of getting better pictures of my kids.  I have not been disappointed.  This 35mm 1.4 lens is so fast that in good light it will completely stop their movement and it will take nice pictures in low light and still autofocus with no problems.  I am just an amateur and still have a lot to learn about photograpy but this lens has turned out some outstanding pictures already that I never saw with my mid level lenses that I initially bought with my camera.  This lens has made me such a fan of fast prime lenses that I just orderd the 135 f2.

I guess I need to include more?Umm, this lens is amazing.  It's stellar.  It has absolutely no negatives.The sharpness is outstanding, especially from f/4.0 and up.  f/8 is superb, especially if you turn off in-camera sharpening and you know what you're doing in post processing.Colors and saturation are some of the best you can get from Canon.  Definitely the best in the lower focal lengths, I think the 35 produces better colors than the 14mm, 24mm, 50mm 1.4/1.8 or 85mm 1.2/1.4.  The 135 is a rival, and the 50 1.2 might be just as good, haven't tried it.  The only lenses that I think compare are the 300 2.8 and the new 200 2.0.  Maybe the old 200 1.8 but good luck finding one.Vignetting, well, if you ask me on a full frame sensor that's a feature for a lens like this.  It's another creative tool for the photographer.  Don't like it?  Open up.  Want more?  Stop down.  On a crop body (especially 1.6x) it's almost non-existant but you can still get a little past f/14.Great build quality.  Solid contruction that withstands the rigors of full-contact wedding photography and various photojournalism assignments, including war zones, the desert, the rain forest, and cold regions.Fast focus for such a large aperture lens.  Great manual focus ring too.Bright in the viewfinder, man this this collects light.Balanced, it feels great on a 5D, 5D II, 1D pro body, or even on a 40D/Rebel prosumer body.  Just long enough to get a good support, short enough to keep the weight centered and balanced.Everything is internal, so you can use any filter you desire.No IS.. thankfully Canon hasn't given in to the IS craze and put IS on this lens yet.

This lens is considered as one of the best lenses Canon makes and its optics and build quality justify the claim. After you have scrutinized the pictures taken with the rented lens, think if you are ready to spend $1500 on a lens that might outlive you.  Here are some pointers to help you make the decision.There are two principal reasons you should consider this lens for -1)Amazing sharpness: The images are razor sharp. It is so sharp at its best(lets say f/5.6) that even Photoshop cannot improve the sharpness.2)Photography without flash: Lets say you have a poorly lit or an almost dark subject which you want to shoot without flash. Do not worry! Put the aperture to f/1.4 and voila! You got yourself a photograph where the subject appears perfectly illuminated . If you cannot trust your eyes for focusing (oh wait! You cannot even see the subject clearly in the dark!) use \"Auto focus\". Auto focus of this lens is very smooth and the USM is terrific.In my view, there are two additional but less pressing reasons to own this lens -1)Focal length- I use a crop sensor, and the 35mm becomes equivalent to 56mm which is a very fitting focal length for general purpose photography. Ranging from close-up, portraits to landscape everything can be covered by it.2) The bokeh it produces is very smooth and buttery.I have not mentioned the contrast and the color saturation because the suffix \"L\" gives away that secret.Is there a reason for which you should think twice before purchasing it ?YES!1)This lens produces chromatic aberrations at higher apertures. In case of back-lit subjects it sometimes produces chromatic aberrations even at f/5.6. Initially I thought I got a bad copy but I later confirmed that chroma aberration is a problem with this lens.2)Some copies seem to backfocus. Among the two copies of this lens I tested, one back-focused at f/1.4. However, some Canon cameras do have an in-built focus adjustment mechanism (micro-adjustment). If you own one of them (7D, 5D and 1D), you can buy any copy of this lens and adjust the focus if needed.Having said all these, I think I will buy this lens again if I have to, because nothing else beats all of its pluses, whereas the close competitors share or even exceed its negatives. Please keep in mind that this lens or any other prime or zoom lens for that matter, is not perfect. It is extremely hard to design a great lens and best lenses are often custom-manufactured by lens designers, and are priced well over $1500.Let me know if you need any information and I will be happy to share my experience of this lens.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Almost a perfect prime", "unixReviewTime": 1331856000, "reviewTime": "03 16, 2012"}

Together with their 135mm f2L, and a good 50mm lens, the 35mm f1.4L completes the kit. The angle is sometimes too wide for good coverage with a single flash, and I almost never use more elaborate lighting setups, so I am typically left using this lens in natural light.

Sharpness continued to increased as I stopped down. By f/8.0, it was unbelievably sharp! That is the \"sweet spot\" for the lens. As I stopped down farther, however, sharpness decreased.

If you use it on a smaller format, as many digital cameras are these days, know what you are getting into.  This is a 50mm lens when used on a 35mm camera, but it is equivalent to a 80mm lens when used on most digital SLR cameras.  Looking at size alone, it would seem to be a good portrait lens on a digital camera, but the lens characteristics indicate it would be better used for other purposes.  I don't understand how it gathers so much light ... it is unusual.  This is an excellent lens, but make sure it is a good match for the job at hand.P.S.If you are wondering about the other lenses I purchased. I love the EF 24-70mm f2.8L. Yes, it is expensive, but it focuses well in low-light situations and the colors are great. The photos take on a third dimension with this lens.What about the EF-S 18-55mm f3.5-5.6II kit lens? Unlike some elitist, I believe this kit lens is very useable for the average consumer. The lens does not have the outstanding color rendition or extra dimension of the L-series lens, but still a very good lens and light weight. It is better then any of my old 35mm lenses.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "A Very Special Lens", "unixReviewTime": 1142121600, "reviewTime": "03 12, 2006"}

It was considered the \"normal\" lens for 35mm at the time.  I must admit, as soon as I could afford it, I started buying accessory lenses.  First a 35mm, then an 85mm, then a 24mm, so it went.  I didn't use a 50mm very much.  I didn't want my photos to look normal so why would I want to use a normal lens?Twenty-odd years later, I bought a used Leica M6 with a 50mm Summicron lens.  Since I couldn't afford another lens for some time after that, I used the 50mm for everything.  This opened my eyes to the possibilities of a normal lens.  No longer did I depend on a lens to give my photos a \"look\", I was depending on myself to make them interesting.  I saw things that I overlooked before and began to make photographs of them.  Light and composition took on a new meaning.  The character of subject matter became the overriding concern--not the angle of view.  It was something of an epiphany for me after so many years.Cameras today come with kit zoom lenses.  Many of them are not very good, but they help to sell the cameras.  I have nothing against zooms but I mostly use primes these days.  Back when I bought the Leica, I also used Canons and I already owned several Canon EF lenses, including primes and zooms and L-series lenses in both prime and zoom formats.  I did not own a 50mm.  So I bought the cheap little f/1.8 II lenses.  While it performed well optically, I really was not comfortable using it.  It lacked a distance scale and the manual focus ring was a royal pain.  I can appreciate lightweight equipment but the 50/1.8 II lens just plain felt like a toy.  Since I was using the 50mm focal length more and more, I decided to spring for the f/1.4 version.  I'm very glad I did.The lens is a joy to use.  It is well built and well designed.  The autofocus seems a little slow compared to some of my other Ultrasonic lenses but it's still extremely fast.  The f/1.4 aperture is truly awe-inspiring if you're used to using f/3.5 kit zooms.  The out-of-focus portions of the picture (the bokeh) is creamy smooth and the in-focus areas are very sharp.  The lens is already sharp at f/1.4 but it picks up even more sharpness and a considerable amount of contrast by stopping down a bit.  I don't test lenses by shooting test targets.  I shoot real pictures of the various subjects that interest me.  In that type of real world testing, this lens gets top grades.Although the 50mm may not be the correct normal lens for a reduced size sensor DSLR, for full-frame DSLR and 35mm film users, I recommend it highly.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The lens you should be using on your film or full-frame DSLR", "unixReviewTime": 1177632000, "reviewTime": "04 27, 2007"}

I tried different settings but I wasn't entirely happy with the performance of the lens. Still, it was far, far better than the original lens that came with the camera (18-55mm). Canon should stop selling that lens, in my opinion, but I digress.The day time shots (indoors and outdoors) came out very well with crystal clear  focus with great bokeh. So, I don't think there's anything wrong mechanically with the lens.  I am happier with the lens as I discovered that at least with my XTi, the indoor, low light shots come out really well at the factory preset mode (turn the dial to \"no flash\" mode). I am able to take shots with truer colors (no more orange hue) that are sharper than my own settings with this simple turn of the knob.  Almost too easy, but I like the results.

Too often, even on a recent body, it doesn't.I've owned two of these lenses, one from the late 1990s and one from 2011. Optically, there's little to complain about. Both copies are sharp in the center from f/1.4. From f/1.4 to f/1.8, there's a fair bit of halation, a gauzy low-contrast glow around objects. This improves portraits, but won't win awards in instrumented testing. From f/2.8 onward, it's very near the best performance available from any lens. Maximum performance is f/5.6 with crop bodies and f/8 with full-frame. Flare isn't much of a bother. Nor is field curvature, where the plane of focus that runs perpendicular to the lens bends at the edges. I've never bothered with, nor felt the need for, the lens hood for this lens. Even lens caps are superfluous with such a recessed front element.A point of technique: depth of field is very shallow at f/2 and below. Focus and recompose, where you focus with the center point and then shift your view before you take the picture, will ensure slightly out-of-focus pictures. You need to select the correct focus point for your composition. The 10D-50D, 7D, and 5D series all have a joystick to make this easier, though the lack of outer cross points on the 5D and 5D II may negate the benefit.The reason I'm giving this lens three stars is the focusing system. It's ostensibly USM, but by way of some hack method that's physically brittle, middling to slow in any light, often inaccurate, and more often inconsistent. It's a world apart from the 85/1.8 and 100/2 of the same vintage. By some great stroke of fortune, and after three rounds with Canon Jamesburg and Canon Irvine, I finally managed to make my first 50/1.4 match my 40D. It was my go-to portrait lens for years. It was accurate, fairly consistent, and not that fast. My hit-rate at f/1.4 and f/1.6 was about 75%. With a 7D, for whatever reason, it was less consistent. The second one, despite a round with Canon Irvine, wasn't ever consistent or accurate on my 50D. Micro focus-adjustment was of no help. My hit-rate was closer to 40%.An update: Roger Cicala at Lensrentals recently tested multiple copies of this lens with a still target and center-point AF on a 5D II. AF missed by a measurable amount 40% of the time and 20% by a noticeable amount.The problem for crop users is that there isn't a comparable portrait lens in this focal length. The 50/1.2 is expensive. The 50/1.8 has less accuracy and middling build quality. Sigma's 50/1.4 misfocuses outside of the 5-15 foot range. If I can't trust a lens, the other attributes pale in importance. For lack of alternatives, it's worth rolling the dice with this 50/1.4, but be prepared to take a lot of refocused safety shots below f/2.

That is no longer always true because of the field-of-view crop of many cameras. Canon's popular digital Rebel and its successors, for example, have a 1.6X view that turns a 50mm lens into an 80mm lens. The 1D MARK II has a 1.3X view that makes it a 65mm lens.So, if you're looking for a standard lens today, 35mm probably is closer to the mark on those cameras. And Canon has a couple of options there - a 35 f/1.4 that is great and expensive and a 35 f/2 that is a good value at about $250.If you're still looking for a 50mm, however, there now are four options from Canon: 50/1.2, 50/1.4, 50/1.8 and 50/2.5. Here are the pros and cons of each:50/1.2 is the newest, fastest and the most expensive at about $1,600. It is an \"L\" lens, which means it is more durably constructed than any of the others. The image quality is a cut above all of the others, especially at wider apertures. If money is no object, you'll probably want this one. But most of the rest of us have to ask the question whether it's 5X better than the 1.4.50/1.4 is maligned by some for the softness of its images at f/1.4, but for me its a good, compact, low-light lens at a terrific price ($325). And the lens gets sharp quickly as you stop it down. It's sharp at f/2 and very sharp by f/2.8 with good contrast and colors.50/1.8 is a step down from the 1.4 in speed, image quality, build quality and the smoothness and noise of its autofocus. But it is a big step up in value - a decent lens for about $80. If you're just getting into digital photography, this is a great lens to learn on until you get a better feel for the lenses that you want/need.50/2.5 - this is a macro lens, although you can use it for general photography, too. I wouldn't recommend it. If you're doing macro photography, spend a little more for the 100/2.8, which is a sharper lens that gives you more subject distance. If you're looking for a standard lens, you'll appreciate the wider aperture of the 1.4.All that said, of the 50mm Canon lenses, I think the 50/1.4 still offers the best mix of image quality and value.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Choosing a \"standard\" lens", "unixReviewTime": 1162080000, "reviewTime": "10 29, 2006"}

Maybe because of my technical background I started testing my own lenses quite a while ago. I have a (no longer so) little test lab of my own where I do 6 different image quality tests (after taking a lens out for a while).The EF 50mm f/1.4 USM is Canon's medium-budget 50 mm prime lens that combines good image quality with a compact and lightweight form factor. It has a precise USM motor that allows manual override during autofocus operation but it's an older generation model that's a little slower and noisier than modern USM motors. The lens is solidly built but of the outer parts only the lens mount is made of metal. The very low f-stops available (good maximum aperture) make this lens ideal for available light photography and portraits. Due to its high resolution at higher f-stops it's also suitable for landscapes (not so much on APS-C cameras where the effective focal length is 80 mm). Even wide open the EF 50mm f/1.4 USM has an impressive resolution but color fringes (\"chromatic abberrations\") both in focused (\"transverse CA\") and in blurred (\"axial CA\") parts of the images are a problem with this lens. Distortion is also an issue if the lens is used with a full frame camera. While corner shadow (\"vignetting\") is present it does fade with higher f-stops (narrower apertures) and there is no curvature of the focal plane (\"field curvature\"). The aperture shape is circular and creates even-looking bokeh.The EF 50mm f/1.4 USM costs more than three times as much as theEF 50mm f/1.8 IIbut (unlike the high-end offeringEF 50mm f/1.2L USM) is still affordable for most. The surcharge is paid for a better autofocus motor, higher built quality, a properly sized focus ring and of course a better maximum aperture of f/1.4 rather than f/1.8. I would have hoped that the image quality were also a step upwards but it's very similar to theEF 50mm f/1.8 II(which is probably good enough anyway). In real-life applications however the EF 50mm f/1.4 USM will likely deliver better images just for its superior focusing operation. If you are on a tight budget you'll be more than happy with the lower-cost offering but if you can easily afford it the EF 50mm f/1.4 USM will be a nicer lens to use.A much more detailed review of this lens together with all test shots, sample images and technical data is available on my website LensTests_com.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "The autofocus makes the difference", "unixReviewTime": 1337126400, "reviewTime": "05 16, 2012"}

Granted, the 50 1.8 lens is awesome for it's dirt cheap price, but it is outclassed by the f/1.4 in all respects.Others have already raved about the virtues of this cheap (not really) lens, so I'll just agree with with the strong points, and lay out the broad picture on an open table.First, the 50 f/1.8 is usually a fine lens. It is dirt cheap, has better quality control than anything built by Sigma, and is super light weight. That being said, it does have issues with lens to lens quality, it is \"only f/1.8\", has a plastic lens mount, and is pretty slow in AF.The 50 f/1.4, on the other hand, can darn near allow you to see in the dark through the viewfinder, can focus in total darkness with the right shoe mount flash, records tack sharp images at most all apertures, has great contrast, is light in weight, small in size, has a metal lens mount, and is pretty cheap to buy.It is NOT an L lens in construction, yet it offers L lens optical quality. It does have a USM, but it is the \"old style\" USM, and is not as fast as the modern ring type USM lenses. Still, it is very fast, it beats the speed of the throw away f/1.8 lens to death, and is pretty darn quiet. Also, despite the majority plastic build, and lack of distance data for E-TTL II flashes (the f/1.8 also lacks this feature) the f/1.4 lens does offer a very responsive full time manual focus ring that works like a charm for manual focus, or just touch up in difficult auto focus situations.This lens is all that, and everyone should own it as their first lens. Zoom lenses included in body/lens kits are just plain junk (sorry), but this lens will stay in your camera kit for decades, no matter what camera body is in your future.People who are using 1.6 crop factor cameras like the 20D, 30D, and Rebel line should bear in mind that the 50 f/1.4 lens is effectively an 80 mm f/1.4 lens when mounted on their cameras. That makes the 50 f/1.4 an awesome portrait lens, and the aperture and diaphragm design of the f/1.4 make it unbeatable for capturing shallow depth of field shots with pleasingly blurred backgrounds.As fine a lens as the 50 mm f/1.8 really is, it cannot begin to compare to the 50 mm f/1.4 lens in terms of functionality. Buy this lens today, and it will be with you until the end, no matter what Canon body you use in the future. If you use a 1.6 crop factor camera today, this lens will become a favorite, and the best 80 mm portrait lens you have ever owned.As always, use it with the factory lens hood at all times (only about twenty five bucks), and use a UV filter that is multi coated on both surfaces at all times. Anyone who suggests that you use a cheap filter is steering you down the wrong path. No matter what lens you buy, always use a UV filter that is built at least as well as your lens. Cheap filters, and filters that are not multi coated on both surfaces are just plain garbage. The shame of it is that even Canon offers garbage filters for cheap, and many people who spend hundreds of Dollars on a lens claim that \"If it's good enough for Canon, it's good enough for me\".

My wife purchased this lense for me as a gift and for the first few months, I had no idea how to harness its true abilities. Here's what I've learned and contemplated:The legendary Nifty-Fifty... It has long been touted the best and \"normal\" focal length for portraiture. Typically, it is the first lens to purchase after buying a DSLR.So why pay 3 times the price for a 1.4 vs the other Nifty 1.8?In terms of light, you're getting roughly 2/3 more light and results in faster shooting.The depth of field becomes far more shallow than the 1.8.You get the amazing, dreamy bokeh effect that is unique to the 1.4.The AF USM micro motor is faster and much quieter. Not quite as fast as a full size USM, but very close.At f2.2 and higher, it is tack sharp, however, I would say that the 1.8 comes very close.It feels better and more significant. I dislike the fact that Canon decided to change the 1.8 mount to the fantastic plastic.It's still tons cheaper compared to the Canon 50mm 1.2L.Now some people have written issues with focusing. It could be very possible these users received a bad lens, but there are a number of other factors to think about while shooting with a bright 1.4 lens.As great as Canon's bodies are, there's a minor issue with this lens and I haven't quite figured out if it's my body (Canon 60D) or if it's a common isssue with bright lenses in general.With that said, I noticed anytime I tried to shoot anything beyond 8 feet away with the aperture wide open at 1.4, the results were blurry 95% of the time. This was even using the center focus and adjust method, which I rely on heavily. It still had a tendency to front focus. I tested this theory by locking the focus, then very slightly, manually adjusting the focus a tad further out. I was able to obtain a nice clear shot at 1.4. But chances are, because the depth of field is still somewhat shallow and shooting wide open can make everything look soft, you're not going to get that nice sharp image you would expect from a prime.Most professionals know that you shouldn't mess with shooting wide open at far distances with a normal focal length lens, cause at that point, you may as well switch to a telephoto lens. But like I mentioned above, it is possible to refocus by guessing. The downside is that no one can rely on a guessing game. As far as what you can see in the viewfinder almost always looks well focused with subjects beyond 8 feet. It is nearly impossible to tell when the subject is truly in focus. If you decide to use this method, you'll begin to learn how your camera reacts to different situations. But keep reading and you'll see there are much better ways of tackling the problem.The problem lies in a lot of crop-body shooters. A lot of times you have to scoot back quite a bit to fit everything in and sometimes forget to raise the aperture.Don't feel defeated because this lens isn't perfect at all situations. No lens is.So when you're shooting subjects 8 feet and further, try this instead:set the aperture between 2.2 to 3.5 to 5.6.That may sound confusing, but here are the scenarios:2.2 Just capturing an individual (or low light situations)3.5 Capturing a group of people (or being in well lit situations)5.6 Capturing some landscape (or in bright daylight situations)You can even push it up to f8 and beyond but I can't see much difference beyond 5.6 most of the times.You'll notice a vast improvement in clarity for all your picture taking regardless of the subjects distance.Don't make the mistake I made by shooting everything wide open, just because you can. The beauty of bright, prime lenses isn't just the fact that they can shoot wide open, but it's also that they're amazingly sharp with higher stops, while providing luscious bokeh.You might say, what's the point in getting a 1.4 if you're going to set it at 2.2 or higher?The real point of having a 1.4 is truly to unleash the artistic expressions as a photographer. Once you feel like you're ready to move up to another level of shooting beyond typical shots, this requires you to have patience and have a subject that is relatively near (in general I would say 8 feet or closer). Don't be afraid to get close! Always focus on a persons eyes and snap away. (I recommend you learn how to use the center focus and adjust method)If you can truly master the 1.4, stepping up to the 1.2 will be a much easier adoption and you'll embrace the reasons behind the price jump.I would avoid using a tripod if possible as shooting with primes can require you to move all over the place to find the perfect compositions.Last, but not least, there is one other trick to getting semi sharp images at 1.4 beyond 8 feet and that is shooting it in live mode. Because it no longer relies on the phase detection and more on a pixel to pixel basis, it's able to get a pretty good focus on whatever subject it's pointed to. The only downside obviously is that the focus takes a long, long, long time... Unless of course you've adopted the Canon 70D.Thanks for reading!

Just one little thing, my brand new lens has a quite loose focus ring. You can feel there's a bit of \"free room\" between the ring and the lens. My Sigma 170-500 DG (not EX) has the exact same problem, giving MF a bit mroe work than it should. But my Canon 70-200L and Sigma 10-20 EX don't have any of it. MF rings on those two are rock solid. So this fact alone makes a little bit suspicious about this 50mm's longevity. Hope I am wrong. Or maybe my sample is the exception.P.S. Now it's 2009. Since then I have acquired quite a few Canon lenses. I'd say the focus ring on this 50 1.4 is far from the worst on a Canon Non-L lens. In fact the only non-L lenses that have a reasonably solid  focus ring are Canon 17-55 IS, which is priced as an L anyway,and the 100mm f/2.0. So now I now, lousy focus ring with no lens hood is the rule of the Canon game. Poor me :)Also, I did some semi serious testing on Sharpness and CA, this 50 f1.4 isn't as sharp as I thought it was in the beginning. In fact the Canon 35mm f2 and 100mm f2 are both better.

I feel like the construction could be better. The focus ring wobbles somewhat, as does the end of the lens (to a small degree) when it is focused to infinity. Autofocus can also be somewhat unpredictable under certain situations. And finally, f/1.4 is really not that sharp. Pictures taken at f/1.4 may or may not be usable (depending on the situation). But they won't really impress. Of course, all of these problems could probably be improved upon by making this lens an L-series (and Canon does indeed now make a 50mm f/1.2L). But, as is the case with the new Canon 50mm f/1.2L, this would certainly increase the price by a factor of 3-4 (or more). And for many of us, putting up with a few hitches is well worth it when you consider the (relatively) low cost of this lens and its (very) positive attributes.So what is so great about this lens? First and foremost, it is sharper than some lenses costing MUCH more. Yes, f/1.4 is not very sharp. But this is alot to ask even for an L-series. Furthermore, even by the time you get to f/1.8, sharpness has improved literally by leaps and bounds. And once you get into the 2's (and above), things are INSANELY sharp - from edge to edge! Simply by tossing that piece of garbage 18-55mm EF-S kit lens and putting this one on, your DSLR will go from taking pictures that look maybe just a little better than a good point-and-shoot to professional looking. You will suddenly find yourself going back and reshooting all those pictures that suddenly look like garbage. You will also find yourself finding creative ways to use this lens for as many different pictures as you can (rather than using other, less sharp lenses that might have a more appropriate focal length). And you will even find other people telling you that you should become a professional photographer because your pictures are so good! It's really THAT good. There is a reason why even many pros prefer this lens over some more expensive lenses. And this is it.But sharpness is not everything. Contrast and color saturation will also rock your world. I have not yet tried a lens that is THIS good. Zooms? Forget it! L-series? Well, I have never really tried one on my camera. And even if they are better, let's not forget the price. I should also note that, although the 50mm f/1.8 mkII comes close to the 50mm f/1.4 in terms of sharpness, reviews have shown that it doesn't come close in terms of contrast or saturation. This lens is simply as good as it gets in this price range.It's just too bad that 50mm is not a more useful focal length on an APS-C camera (where it is equivalent to 80mm on a full frame camera). Yes, it finds good use on my camera.

These filters were purchased with the intent to keep expensive lenses from getting covered in dust or damaged in regular use.These UV filters (and presumably others) work fine initially, but there is something the many positive reviews do not mention - these things are dust MAGNETS.That's right. I don't know what it is about these filters, but once you take your lens cap off you're going to have bits of dust and other airborne contaminants landing on there and getting stuck.A few specks of dust on the lens itself is no big deal - it will not even show in your photos, but the dust that sticks to these filters WILL show up on your photos if your photos have any kind of light areas.If you take a picture of the sky and do not have a perfectly clean B+W UV Haze filter, you will see black spots on the final exposure.I have tried to clean these using cotton cloth, microfiber and even methanol with no luck. By contrast I can keep my lenses clean with a simple puff of air or a wipe with microfiber. Even if there is some dust on my lens it does not show up in the photo as it does when it's stuck on the UV filter.The quality of the glass that these UV filters are made from is also questionable. When I hold the filter up to a light, I can see many imperfections in the glass that appear as frosting. These imperfections are in the glass itself and cannot be cleaned. I have several of these filters and all of them exhibit the same flaws.UV filters do not provide any benefit photographically as digital cameras are not susceptible to the coloration issues that UV light had on film.UV filters can and do diminish the quality of your photos by placing inferior glass in front of your lens. It's a catch-22 -- you paid good money for a lens to take nice photos, only to hamper it by sticking a filter in front of it. With this filter on your lens, every photo you take is like no different than shooting through a window. Contrast and fine detail both suffer.These UV filters will cause \"ghosts\" and other optical anomalies at certain angles that you will not experience if you remove the filter.In the end it's your call if you think it's worth the extra money to make your camera take worse pictures under the false notion that the UV filter offers some kind of \"protection\". Let's face it - if you drop your lens, the possibility for breaking it will not be reduced by having a UV filter on the front.UV filters DO NOT keep your lens clean because they themselves attract dust and dirt, in addition to being optically inferior to the glass used in the lens, so the net result is a photo that would have been better with no filter at all.Save your money for something more useful like another lens, a good flash or a quality bag to carry your gear.

I'd have to really pick this camera apart to tell you the downsides of it; disregard reviews by those who think this camera is not up to par -- of course it's not comparable to the EOS 1-Series or a 5D, so don't expect the same features or capabilities. The right user, however, can get similar results.That said, unless you are a professional photographer, I cannot imagine how the Digital Rebel could be inadequate for any amateur or semi-pro shooter. It's speed and megapixels have since been passed by, but it's still, especially now, a great buy.The kit lens will perform for you just fine, although most of my shots with the kit lens are at 18mm, landscape or just wide-angle shots. The flash works very well in most situations, even in extremely dark rooms. One guy complained his AF hunted in low light situations, even with flash...of course, what do you expect in a dark room? Use manual focus and grow up.Quality is great from ISO 100-400, although 800 can be somewhat ugly at times, and 1600 is basically unusable, especially if you're not shooting at f/2.8 or bigger.My main complaints: slow start-up time compared to the newer models (XT, 20D, etc) ... camera seems to be out of breath after continuous shooting; take 8 shots quickly and you may notice the camera needs to process info before it can shoot again. 2.5 frames/second is not very fast if you're shooting any sports.Overall, this camera has been incredibly reliable for me; it's gotten me front page shots on newspapers, magazine covers, calendars and websites. I used it so much that I blew out the shutter in 10 months; Canon fixed it at no charge and it works fine since. One minor problem: very rarely, it won't turn on unless I remove the battery and re-insert it.I've found the battery life to be fantastic. I can use it all day, even with flash, and still have some life at the end of the day. A backup battery in your bag should give you more than enough insurance for a day.I've printed at 11x17 with excellent results.With some practice, it's very easy to navigate. Menus and options are simple; changing the ISO or aperture is very easy despite what some have complained about. It's very reliable in fully-auto mode as well, especially if you're shooting with flash.

{"reviewerID": "A2Y3FAO82SU0M0", "asin": "B0000C8VEK", "reviewerName": "H. W", "helpful": [23, 26], "reviewText": "I just bought and used this camera for about three weeks (without the kit lens since I have several other Canon lenes already, which are better than the kit lens in terms of image quality). Canon recently throws a lot of rebates on this model (up to $300 rebate if you buy two other Canon lenses). This is an incredible deal. Is this the best entry level DSLR? My answer is \"probably yes, but with some reservation on its features\". Marketed as an entry level DSLR, it is reasonable to expect some tradeoff due to cost cutting. But some of Canon's design decisions are puzzling at best, which compromises its quality and functionality, without reducing overall cost (in other words, it could be done better without incurring additional cost). Here is my exprience.On the up side:The camera feels solid with the right weight. Originally I though it may feel flimsy and overly light since it is made of plastic (the feeling you get of Canon Rebel film camera), but as soon as I took that out of the package, I started to like its weight (not too heavy as you feel for metal-bodied SLR, not too light). Of course, it is still heavier (with lens attached) than consumer grade digital cameras.The camera's operation is much like other Canon SLRs. It has same lens mount (EF mount) as all other modern Canon SLRs which also means you can use all your Canon EF lens (or other third party lenses which conform to EF standard, I use a Tamron lens on this camera without problem). It can also use new EF-S mount lens which is what the kit lens uses. But since EF-S lens is relatively new and can be only used on this camera (and D20 which newly comes out), be aware of Canon's commitment to this lens format in the long term and prepare to throw away EF-S lenses after several years. The controls on the back side of the camera is different than most Canon's consumer grade digital cameras and film SLRs. So if you come from these worlds, there is something to learn, but not too much though.Image quality is superb. Not only it has 6Mpixel resolution, but the overall noise level of image is very low. At ISO 100, image is silk smooth. At ISO 800, noise is visible but pretty controlled. At ISO 1600, noise is much bigger, but still usable, especially you use some noise reduction tools to post processing such image. It surely beats ALL consumer and prosumer level digital cameras on the noise front. And the reason is it uses large CMOS sensor, much bigger than smaller CCD sensor used in consumer digital cameras. So if you are looking at low light performance, you have to use a DSLR like Canon digital rebel. Of course, the image quality of a DSLR also depends on what lens you use. Most of Canon's lenses should deliver better results than most consumer digital cameras.The builtin flash pops up high, which is good. Unlike the flash on film rebel, which pops up low and its light may be obstructed by some large lenses, this flash should work well for most lenses. However, see my comments below, it does have some shortcomings.Focusing is adequate as you can expect from a SLR. The seven point auto focus sometimes does the wrong focusing, and you can select focus point to overcome this. It is not superb, but not bad either.Now comes the down side:Compact flash write speed is quite slow. Even use a high speed CF card (I use Lexar 80X), it still appears slow and not utilizes the full potential of these fast CF cards. When you shoot 4 photos at once, you have to wait the camera buffer to be emptied to CF to continue. This takes somewhere from 10 seconds to 20 seconds depending on your CF card.No LCD display of image you are trying to shoot. Almost all consumer digital cameras allow you view objects in the LCD screen. You have to look closely though the small viewfinder window to track objects. This is a very convenient feature to have so I am wondering why Canon does not do this if it is targeting non-professional photographers.There is no flash compensation. Again you can find this feature on many Canon's consumer level digital cameras. Another disappointment.Metering is odd. You have to use the standard evaluative mode most of the times without any other choices. I'd like to see different metering modes available under all shooting modes. Occasionally, I feel some images are underexposed.Downloading images to your computer is absolutely painfully slow. It uses a USB 1.1 interface - why not USB 2.0 or firewire? The download speed feels slower than the old Canon G2 I have. If you shoot a full 2GB of images, expect several hours of downloading.Why a seperate battery charger? Old Canon G2 has builtin battery charger so you don't need to pull out the bettary to charge. Moving battery in and out every time it runs out is a hassel.So overall, I think it is a great camera, but if Canon can do more to fix/enhance these issues, that would make this camera an absolute hit. Also at this price range (I paid $750 before rebate) it is the lowest priced DSLR on the market.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "The best entry level DSLR?

But a couple of years ago, I wanted to make the switch to digital.  The Canon digital SLRs were out of my price range ($3K to start), so I purchased a Powershot G2 digital point and shoot, which I loved, but my lenses sat unused in my closet.Well, I fret no more as Canon came out with the much more affordable Digital Rebel for under $1,000 and I finally took the plunge.  A great decision.  Now I can use my lenses.  I have a 50mm 1.8 (word of advice - if you don't have it yet, get this lens - the best $80 you'll spend on your hobby), 28-135mm Image stabilizer and a 75-300mm zoom along with the 18-55mm kit lens that came with the Digital Rebel.  This along with the 380EX flash that I have had for 5+ years give me the arsenal to take good shots in most conditions.  You can set ISO to 800 or 1600 to get clear indoor shots or sports action, and the noise associated with these settings is much more acceptable to me than the 400 ISO setting provided on my G2.  And as far as portraits go, combine the 50mm lens with the flash and I've taken some of the best face shots in my life.Also making me happy is that Rebel takes the same battery as the G2, so I use my G2 battery plus the Rebel battery along with the two extras I bought), meaning I should never run out of power (what helps with battery life is that unlike the G2, you can't use the display monitor to frame the picture, you must use the viewfinder).  Plus the camera takes Compact Flash cards, again like the G2, so I don't have to spend on new memory.If I have a gripe, is that some pictures come out a tad underexposed even with the flash, but this is generally remedied in image software.  And I miss the movie mode in the G2, but certainly can live with it.After 4 months, all is well with the Rebel and I can't wait to upgrade in the future.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "If You're A Canon 35mm Fan, Time To Make The Move To Digital", "unixReviewTime": 1082505600, "reviewTime": "04 21, 2004"}

My first was one of the very old Olypus digitals; no removable storage, just a cable to the computer, 120 low resolution or 30 medium resolution shots and then the memory was full.  The colors were always off, there was no zoom, and it was amazing that it worked at all.  No wonder I also bought a pocket 35mm camera to take &quot;real&quot; pictures since the Olympus' were so small, grainy, and colorless.  At least the 35mm had a datestamp option.  3 years later I bought the Canon PowerShot S30, then when I lost it (or had it stolen?) I replaced it with the S40.  The PowerShot S50 sold today is the same body style with more pixels and a couple of annoyances fixed.This camera is NOTHING like those cameras.  I had plenty of complaints about the S30 &amp; S40.  My biggest gripe was missing the shot.  I take pictures of children, especially at school functions.  I would line up a wonderful shot, push the button... and they would move!  They'd get up and walk away, they'd turn around, they'd crowd into the subject, I was missing 80% of my shots.  About a year later, the shutter would finally click.  So my hard drive is filled with so-so shots that would have been winners if that annoying delay hadn't gotten me... again!No problem with the Digital Rebel.  Press the button, focus is lightning-fast, then click goes the shutter.  You look through the viewfinder to frame your shot, not at the back on those hard-to-read LCD screens.  Several modes allow multiple pictures, just in case, such as in Sports mode. I am seeing such an improvement in my pictures since I got this camera a few weeks ago.  First of all, they are always framed properly, because I'm not dealing with sudden motion after shutter release, nor am I dealing with an LCD for a viewfinder, or a &quot;viewfinder&quot; that makes me correct for parallax.  Next, the colors are amazing.  Third, 6.3 megapixels... when would I ever want that much?  When I want to crop 80% of the picture and still print what's left!It is great to have a camera with some heft that still doesn't feel like a brick.  As everyone else says, get the kit lens.  It is 18 to 55mm, so a nice wide-angle lens for group shots, etc.  I find 55mm not close enough for shooting children; the S30/S40 I mention above has an 11-55mm range which I already knew to be insufficient for shooting kids. Thus I bought the Canon 28-200mm zoom lens and keep that one on the camera, only switching to the kit lens when I do big groups or a lot of similar portraits (that big zoom lens weighs four times as much as the body!)Yes, it is an amazing camera for &quot;under&quot; $1000.  Truth be told, I spent more than that on accessories; the 28-200mm lens was almost $500, with 6.3 megapixels you might as well buy the biggest flashcard you can, and that's 2 GB these days; you'll need a case, you really ought to buy skylight filters to protect those lenses from getting scratched, an extra battery is a really good idea... well, you see what I mean.Still an amazing camera, especially after dealing with those tiny toys for all these years.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "totally outstanding digital camera", "unixReviewTime": 1068422400, "reviewTime": "11 10, 2003"}

The two HUGE advantages the Canon has is that 1 -- there is NO shutter delay that makes you miss the shot:  the shot is taken as soon as you press the button and 2 -- you can buy high quality lenses that make the camera even more amazing.  Let me say I'm not a pro photographer or anything, but I figured out how to use all the features of this camera within a day or so.  It's very intuitive and fun.  Don't be afraid to step up from your non SLR camera.  Besides, you can still \"point and shoot\" in automatic modes, but it's awesome to be able to control just the aperature or just the shutter speed.  The pictures this camera takes are incredible!!!  I have to admit I've gotten gadget fever.  I'll make some recommendations based on my two weeks with the camera.1 -- buy a 1GB or bigger compact flash card with fast download speed.  At big megastores they are very much discounted.  Also, don't forget to REFORMAT the card every time you put it back -- my old cards always got \"corrupted\" and the way to avoid that is to reformat every time (just takes 2 seconds -- use the \"format card\" option on the camera menu).2 -- buy an external flash.  You'll notice that the internal flash tends to overexpose yoru subjects -- I bought the Canon 420 (or something like that) and it's amazing. My pics are TWICE as good3 -- I'd recommend NOT buying the kit lens and putting that money towards the exact Canon EF lens you'll need.  I bought one zoom and one prime lens and the quality is 10 times better. Plus, a 1000 camera deserves high quality lenses.4 -- don't forget the crop factor when you buy lenses!  It's hard to find this out on your own, but because of where the sensor is on Digital SLRS, you have to multiply the focal length of the lens by 1.6.  So, a 35 mm lens if you put it on this camera is equivalent to a 55mm lens, and so on.  Plus, if you have other non-digital cameras, be sure to be EF lenses only, not EF S which only fit on digital cameras.My only complaint (and this is nitpicking) on this camera is that I wish the finish were tougher looking and not quite so plasticky.  I like the Nikon cameras and upper level canon camera materials, but I understand that this is how Canon can sell a camera which is optically as good as the 10D for a lot less. On the plus side, it's nice and light.These are my thoughts after the first few weeks -- I LOVE the camera overall and now that I have two great lens, my pics look almost professional, not bad for a mom who doesn't know much about photography.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Almost idiot proof", "unixReviewTime": 1107561600, "reviewTime": "02 5, 2005"}

Well guess what, that is exactly what the Digital Rebel provides!Much to my surprise, all of my old EOS EF lenses work very well with this camera and I am getting much better results than I expected.  This is a huge improvement over my other digicams - better resolution, color, overall quality, and I am in awe of what I get with my long telephoto lens.A few notes.  First, buy the kit lens (18-55mm EF-S); for $100 you'll use the lense and it is an incredible value (certinaly worth 2 to 3 times the cost).  Second, if you take many indoor photos you'll want an external flash; I went with Canon's 420EX unti as it provides E-TTL exposure (essentially, the amount of flash is controlled by what the camera meters through the lens - a pretty amazing capability).  Third, get a good amount of memory, like 2 512K card; its relatively inexpensive and by taking lots of photos you'll learn more about the camera's abilities sooner.I am getting very long battery life (well into many hundreds of photos per charge), so unless you are headed off into the woods you may be able to hold off on purchasing a spare battery.In summary, if you are an old 35mm EOS photographer, this is a complete no brainer since you get to use your lens investment.

And the manual control of the camera gives you a lot of artistic freedom I have yet to see in other cameras.

You have no clue what a difference that makes in a small room! This camera is a great value! The only problem I had is that after 18,000 shots in 90 days the auto-focus went out, something that could be easily repaired by Canon but since the store I bought it from has a 90-day return policy I opted to return the camera and buy a Canon 10D.Some small annoyances I wish Canon will fix since Nikon is hot on their tail- The slap of the mirror is in excess.

It does delivery nicely on all of that promise.  Unfortunately, Palm handicapped the E with one inexplicable design flaw that outweighs all of its upside - they somehow failed to include the ironically-named \"universal connector\" for recharging and syncing the unit.  Instead, it comes with two separate jacks on its underside:  one mini-USB for data sync and one AC adapter plug, leaving you faced with an unnecessary clutter of cords crossing your desk.In the beginning, I wanted to give the E every chance I could based on its functionality, and so I was lenient on this design oddity.  Still, the inconvenience eventually made me hate using it.  The plug design basically forces you into a choice between two very imperfect options - (a) threading the cords to the front of your desktop somehow so that you can have it right-side-up and still use it while plugged in, or (b) putting the cords behind the desk where they belong with the others and then suffering with an upside-down Palm.  With option (a), the relatively short cords and large jacks also put the unit at high risk of being knocked or dragged off of the desk.  With option (b), even syncing became a chore - the lack of a cradle button to trigger a sync means that you have to power up the unit and kick it off via on-screen icons, all while looking at it upside-down or else yanking a bunch of messy excess cord onto your desk.Still, I wanted to make the most of the E's robust bundle of applications, and for its low price, I knew not to expect that everything would come standard in the box.  So I went shopping for a proper charging cradle, only to find that no such accessory for the E exists.  In fact, Palm doesn't even sell replacements for its individual sync/charging cables at all.  So, aside from all routine inconvenience while using it, this model also comes with the incredible risk that if either cord is every lost or damaged, you become the proud owner of a sleek-looking $200 paperweight.  It's possible by now that some third-party company has begun creating unlicensed cords that claim to be compatible, but that's hardly comforting in the face of Palm's obvious lack of support for its own product line.And given the weak battery that the E is equipped with (and it can't be upgraded), you'll have it connected to the charging cord quite a bit.  When I was using it religiously every workday, I needed to recharge it each night.  What a disappointment this setup is compared to, for example, the Tungsten T3 - it uses the universal connector to dock with a cradle that continuously charges it and syncs it on command while keeping it at an ideal ergonomic angle for use/reference while sitting on your desktop.  And since its using the universal connector, you're able to accessorize it further, i.e. buy a separate docking cradle for the office, a charger for the road, etc.  The T3 setup makes perfect sense, the E setup is shamefully inadequate - it's as if Palm wants E owners to never forget that they purchased \"the cheap one\".In conclusion, its advertised plusses are very real, but go for the Tungsten E at your own risk.  Its greatest failure is that there is no obvious reason why it couldn't have lived up to its potential as the ultimate PDA.  The more you live with its one Achilles' Heel, the more you'll wish you'd spent a little extra on the T3.PROSVersatility and quality of applications that it runs (MS Office, Acrobat, MP3, photos, movies, etc.)Brilliant color displayCONSLack of universal connector makes everyday use/charging/syncing more and more irritatingLack of Palm support for the E, as in no replacement cords available, makes it a risky option", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Lack of \"Universal\" Connector Ruins an Otherwise Great PDA", "unixReviewTime": 1119312000, "reviewTime": "06 21, 2005"}

As you probably guessed, I have to have a small handheld.  In my opinion, if it isn't small enough, you won't bring it with you and actually use the thing.  I also have been a fond lover of this form factor (very thin and light with double-stylus holder, etc.Well, they finally listened to us complaining of the previous left side &quot;flap holder&quot; and made the flap slide in from the bottom of the palm as apposed to the top.  This was a large problem -- I've had my old palms slide out on me at random by holding it from the flap.The good:  This palm has an astounding display!  It literally feels as though you have a small computer in your hand as other reviewers have mentioned.  Quality all the way here.  Large enough to be easily readable, and a brightness level adjustment that gets quite bright!  The buttons on the bottom &quot;mostly&quot; have a positive feedback.  I'll discuss the bottom lack of a universal connector last.  This palm accepts SD cards and has a headphone jack on the top.  Processor is incredible compared to my old m515 and especially the V.  Power button is recessed so you can't &quot;accidentally&quot; turn it on as easily as past models.Honestly, I must mention that I've tried to purchase quite a few MP3 players out there and they have all had quirky problems.  I didn't even expect to use the mp3 capabilities of this PDA but look at that -- it works/sounds better than anything I've purchased for the same cost that was dedicated to MP3s!!!  I am truly astounded by it.The bad/interesting:  As I mentioned above, the buttons mostly have tactile feedback, but that square ring of a button-pad in the center is a bit odd because pushing down requires quite a bit more force than up and does not result in a &quot;click&quot;.  Hrm...I guess it just sort of happened because of the small size of this unit (4.6 oz folks - yes you heard me right!).Finally, that bottom connector issue that has quite an argument brewing.  This is the only Tungsten lacking a universal connector on the bottom which means you can't use all those old accessories which utilized that port.  Lets look at some other aspects here....It uses a standard USB cable which means you're not restricted to palm to purchase additional hotsync cables.  Also, it has a small power cord which plugs in the other port on the bottom.  This I think is wonderful because I can actually take the power cable/charger and charge it on vacation or wherever I am.  No longer do I have to lug around the cradle in my suitcase!Finally, the iffy:  This palm looks like metal - but alas is made out of plastic.  Rest assured it is extremely sturdy plastic -- no creaking or anything Handspring-like and the plastic is actually the color you see -- that silver color.  So we shouldn't have to worry about any coating chipping off and revealing an ugly color underneath.So far, I'm extremely pleased with this palm, and though it has these minute setbacks, I still think it is a wonderful unit especially for the price.  I was able to keep my small form factor and get a wonderful display and an overall great feature set.  Finally - I must mention that this comes with a LOT of software.  Documents to go Ver 6 which allows you to read/write word, excel and powerpoint docs, an mp3 player by realone, photo viewer, and the list goes on and on.  Add that to their new personal manager programs like Contact and Calendar and you have a winning combination!  If you're on the borderline between this and the new T3 - well, I chose it because I'm not all that trusting of the slider mechanism.  I like a palm that sits there with the least amount of moving parts/possible failure points.

We've had none of the problems reported by the other reviewers here. Each T|E has performed flawlessly. No problems with the buttons, display, software, or anything else. I haven't found any software, other than some really old stuff, that was incompatible (and that old software seems incompatible with all recent Palms). We've had no problems with the Palm Desktop software (WinXP) and no problems synchronizing with our desktops. Further, we like the new version of Graffiti. In other words, we have almost nothing to complain about.However, it is safe to say the batteries run down fairly quickly between charges. This has not been a major issue for us. While we use our PDA's many times each day, each use is only for a few moments. However, there have been times when we wanted to use them for longer periods of time without being plugged in. We solved this by purchasing inexpensive external AA battery packs, offering eight to nine hours of almost continious use without a recharge (search on the internet for \"Tungsten E battery pack\").A friend's T|E once had many of the same problems reported here (crashes, freezes, blank screens, reset issues, and so on). His problem was traced to the installation of hacks and software which radically changed the function or appearance of the operating system. Once most of these were removed, his TE immediately performed much more reliably. Perhaps this is a solution for some of the other reviewers here.Note: I wrote the above in October, 2004.

The first one I bought (from Buy.com) had the alarm problem that others have mentioned. I called Palm support which is now outsourced and horrible who told me to do a hard reset and try again...same issue after the hard reset after which time I sent the PDA back to Buy.com. I bought my second one from Palmone.com. I figured I'd be better off buying it from \"the source\" directly. Same alarm problem, hard reset and all. The alarm only sounds a fraction of the tone so you can easily miss it. The alarm only works properly when the unit is turned ON. I have several peers with the Tungsten E and EVERY ONE OF THEM HAVE THIS ISSUE. I emailed Palm support with this info, figured maybe there is a firmware or OS update. Their response?....do another hard reset and if it does not work return it for another. %()&^%$!!!!! Not this time!All in all, aside from this, I actually happen to like this PDA. OS 5.2.1 is a nice upgrade from OS 4 from my Clie. The screen resolution is excellent. The MP3 player sounds great with nice headphones or buds. I have NOT had the \"noisy screen\" issue.The lack of a cradle and 2 seperate cords for charge and sync I consider only a minor inconvenience. I use a Krusell leather case so I don't worry about the fingerprints others complain about.Oh, and for the record I downloaded a program called \"emerald sounds\" from freewarepalm.com. This replaces the system MIDI sounds so you can put a louder and longer tone into the alarm so you are more likely to hear it.One more thing; if I had to rate Palms support now I would give it ONE STAR and that would be generous. It has gone down the tubes since the days of my Palm IIIxe!! But then again, Sony's PDA support is/was notiously poor as well.In the end, the Tungsten E is a nice PDA for $190-$200.

I find that utterly amazing.  You certainly wouldn't do that on an old Palm V, and the B&amp;W Clie was pretty limited in this regard.Great for Audible Books: I use the built-in MP3 player mainly for recorded books, as opposed to music.  I've listened to a few music tracks and thought they sounded nice, though I'm definitely not an expert on MP3 players.  It is great for audiobooks, however.  The sound quality is great and with a big enough SD card, you can fit several volumes.PalmOS 5 is very nice.  The Clie had 4, which wasn't much of an improvement on OS 3Performance.  The Tungsten E has the response time I was used to with the Palm V, even when accessing the memory card.  The Clie was unacceptably slow in this regard.Software: The included Outlook conduit is the best I've seen yet; better than the Palm V version or the more recent Clie version.

Gerber \"samthewebman\"", "helpful": [30, 31], "reviewText": "I gave up my 6 year old Personal Palmpilot in favor of this beauty. I've found it has the best function for the price. Better than the ZIRE 71 if you give up the camera. Has 32MB of memory and comes with Documents to Go to process Excel and Word files. ZIRE doesn't have these two things. Also should mention that there's a terrific calculator included on the CD called Power One. Most amazing software I've seen for a calculator. It supports and provides templates for Loan Calculations, Metric Conversions, Math functions and many more.In all, this is definitely a 5-star product. Enough has been said here that I won't share my enthusiasm with you. I should say that the protective front cover that came with mine does not scratch my case, as has been mentioned frequently here. I was given the $40 Palm metal case as a gift and kept it. It's very protective but does interfere completely with the power button, hot-synch connection and charger input ... strong negatives.To the matter at hand, the title of this review.It is not well known that the Tungsten E and one other new T model have introduced a broadening of the fields available in the Address Book PIM application, now called \"Contacts\". This application in modeled after Msoft Outlook and has serious drawbacks, IF NOT UNDERSTOOD BY THE USER.Many fields have been added which are supported by the handheld and the desktop which will cause endless grief if you need to interface the Tungsten E later to another application by exporting data.Briefly, there are now 9 Custom fields (not 4), 7 Phone fields (not 5), 3 sets of Address fields (not 1), 2 IM fields (for Chat IDs), a Web Site field, and a Birthday field. In all, there are 21 extra fields compared to most other Palms.Generally speaking, this is very good and could be a compelling reason to buy the Tungsten E. However, here's what I've learned:My first 5 phone fields have default labels of WORK, HOME, MOBILE, E-MAIL and MAIN. While these can be changed as you enter new contacts, they are very poor choices for all users. WORK and MAIN are largely redundant, FAX is missing completely, and E-MAIL should be last because it's not a phone. This forces you to do a lot of tapping to enter the proper labels for each new contact. All earlier Palms had these default labels: WORK, HOME, FAX, OTHER and E-MAIL, a very sensible choice.Nothing can be done about this \"bug\" from my dialogues with Palm and I have yet to discover a fix on the Google message boards.This becomes critical to you from a productivity point of view and disastrous if you try to export your phone data to another program. Take this message with you: Whatever you choose to call your phone labels, be consistent from one Contact to another or your fields will export improperly. Palm's export will export all these fields in the physical order entered, top to bottom, REGARDLESS OF YOUR FIELD LABELS! So you must be consistent or you will never export them as you intend.Similarly, the 2 extra sets of address fields are called \"H\" and \"O\", in addition to the first set called \"W\". Please don't think that the Desktop software will honor these labels. The first one you enter will be exported as \"WORK\", the second as \"HOME\", etc., NO MATTER WHAT LABEL YOU GIVE IT! So ... if you ever plan to export a Contact's Home Address to Outlook or any other program, you must enter some dummy information as \"Work\" and then enter the Home information. The Palm sees these three sets of addresses as Address 1, 2, and 3, NOT Work, Home, Other. So if you enter Home first, then Work, you're headed for trouble if you Export.Finally, the Export dialogue is equally screwed up by showing the phone field names in a different order than above. My message here is to ignore those label names because they will Export in the same order you've entered them, regardless of what the dialogue says. This has caused me endless grief until I understood what was happening.These flaws will not affect many of you but they are well worthy of note and understanding. Palm surely must fix this one day, but that's the way it is now.Otherwise, this is a 5-star offering, despite this serious deficiency which can be worked around now that you understand it.Enjoy your Tungsten E if you take the plunge.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "WATCH OUT FOR THE NEW CONTACTS (Address Book) FIELDS!", "unixReviewTime": 1072656000, "reviewTime": "12 29, 2003"}

This is quite simply, a beautiful piece of engineering, and whether you are new to PDAs or upgrading, you will not be disappointed...For a bargain price of 200 smackers, Palm provides the following key features:1) A top-notch, large, hi-res screen (check it out in a store first). Many previous Palms have skimped on the screen -- a big no-no in my book. I'd much rather have a slower processor than an unreadable (m505) or too-small screen (Zire, m100). Pointing and clicking on a Palm is hard enough without having a small, dark screen to boot.2) Generous 32 MB Ram. Finally, Palm stops skimping on this important area! It's not enough to make you ditch your iPod, but you can play a few tunes, look at a few pictures, transfer some files. This is a big improvement from the bad-old 8 MB days, which is Okay for contacts but worthless for anything else.3) Rechargeable lithium polymer. Top notch. No skimping, no muss, no fuss.4) Great design. Clean, simple, portable, shirt-pocketable. No keyboard, but I've never been a thumbpad fan.5) MS Office functions included -- Word, Outlook, Powerpoint. Why you would use them, however, is a bit bizarre to me. Who wants to spend the time coding in a Powerpoint presentation with a stylus? Yet, if this is important to you, it's here. And having your email with you can be a plus...As for what you won't get: There is no phone, no camera, no thumbpad, no Bluetooth, no WiFi. This is close to a pure PDA, though it can display pictures and double as a poor-man's MP3 player. That's what I was looking for.Here's a basic product guide:New Palm Zire -- Bargain basement model with 7.2 MB of Ram, upgraded from hobbled 2 MB original model. About 100 smackers. Often offered free as bundle deals with new computers. Good starter model for the price. Includes rechargeable battery. Memory can not be upgraded. Horribly skimpy black-on-grey screen.Tungsten T2, etc.: Deluxe models that feature, in some cases, larger screens/Bluetooth wireless connectivity/thumbpads with dropdown graffiti screens. All unnecessary features in my book, especially given their much higher prices.Clie models (SJ30, etc.) recently have owned the mid-range of the Palm product line, providing color screens, style and multimedia features for less than Palm. But no longer. The Clie models simply can not compete with this new Palm -- they feel and look clunky in comparison and generally feature smaller, dimmer screens. And the upper-echelon Clie models get very expensive.Sony models also have a reputation for less-stellar customer service. (I've had excellent service from Palm.)The Treo models from Handspring/Palm should be considered if you are a thumbpad fan, or if you want your PDA to also be your phone. But let's face it, how many people can afford spending four hundred smackers on a PDA?BTW, when comparing, I've found you can generally ignore the speed of the processor. For most Palm functions, the reaction time is near instantaneous, or at most a second or two lag.As for PocketPCs, some of them are now very attractively priced and are worth checking out. I've yet to use one extensively, so I'll stick to what I know -- Palms are simple, easy to use and almost guaranteed to improve your productivity. It's like having a backup for your brain.

When I called  in August 2005 about having my pda replaced I was told I would be getting a new one right away, instead I got a box to send mine to them to fix it. Then they sent it back-still non-working and in worse physical condition that when I sent it off. Their website to check the status of repairs said my repair was completed, the box my pda came back in says 'Factory Reconditioned' but my pda still does not work-AND THEY PUT DINGS AND SCRATCHES IN THE SIDES OF THE OUTER CASE!!!! They claim my pda had water damage and that it isn't covered under my warranty....I work in a retail store...INSIDE OF A BUILDING...and my pda was in a protective case on my belt. Circuit city also refuses to explain how the outer case was damaged. I have called and emailed constantly with then, until they stopped responding as of 11/27/05, I have been told several time I would be getting a replacement or a gift card so I can buy a new pda, but then the next person I talk to lies and says I was NEVER told that and that they don't do that. Supposedly the motherboard needs to be replaced in it, which can be found online for $39-$59, but they can't be bothered to spend that to repair it under that warranty I bought, which they now say is not a real warranty, and that I bought another kind of warranty, which does not actually cover anything, other than a manufacturer's defect, that is covered by the manufacturer original warranty. Don't buy from circuit city, and don't be fooled into buying their \"extended coverage\" or \"extended warranty\", they won't honor the warranty they sell.This review may only legally be shown directly on Amazon.com", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "my first pda-and horrible experience with circuit city", "unixReviewTime": 1135814400, "reviewTime": "12 29, 2005"}

The reviews I read were helpful, well written and I was stimulated to write my own. There were basically two groups of reviews, one being highly complimentary of the RS-120 and the other group complained about noise, hiss, and comfort. My own review falls in the first group. However I must say that noise and hiss can happen in some environments and are not necessarily a problem with the headphone. In fact, it is easy for me to induce noise/hiss when I approach the motor of the refrigerator or I approach the emitter from other electronic equipment. Noise/hiss are nightmares for engineers and sometimes there is not much that we can do to eliminate these problems in the immediate physical world that surrounds us.

So I was just looking to use these headphones for TV use.  However, out of curiosity, I walked up stairs and clear across the other side of our house and outside of some occassional hissing, the signal was still strong.  Given my intended use, signal strength, clarity, ease of use and value were the primary critieria and the RS-120 has met or exceeded my expectations for each of these criteria.Just a few other comments: 1. The comments of how you need to retract the headphones to allow for charging is true, but this really isn't a big deal in my opinion, and is more than compensated for by the ease of the charging mechanism which simply requires you to set the headphones down on the base.  2. The receiver automatically turns on when it receives a signal and turns off after a few minutes if the signal stops.  This was a pain when I paused a movie for a while and had to turn the TV off and on again to get the headphones restarted.  I'm not sure why simply turning the movie back on didn't do the trick since it resulted in a new signal????  However, the upside of this set up is that you don't always have to remember to turn off the base unit on your own.  3. The headphones have it's own on/off switch.  4. There's a volume and fine tuning adjustment on the headphone that can easily be adjusted without taking them off your head.  The set up is very intuitive.  5. Contrary to some other reviews, the pair that I received came with two adapters that allowed for easy connection to a standard headphone outlet or computer.Bottom line, I did a lot of research before purchasing the RS-120 and I am still very satisfied.

I purchased these so my wife can watch TV while I sleep. Unfortunately... after a few weeks of trying to live with them, we gave up and eventually sold for at a garage sale for $5.Actually... when the work, they work quite well. Yes, there are bursts (pops) of static as you move around while wearing them  (like you might hear on a AM radio station turning a thunder storm) but it wasn't a deal breaker for me. If you sit in a chair, or are in bed, and remain stationary the static pops don't occur. They do emit constant nonstop static but its very minimal (similar to the white noise you hear when wearing noise canceling headsets). Then again... if you are an audiophile it will drive you nuts! I wouldn't recommend them for music but can tolerate it for TV viewing.  For most people its notAnd issue. In fact, many don't even hear it (which explains the positive reviews)Actually... ignoring the static issue... they sound quite good.The problem is... they only work as long as there is sound being broadcasted! Once the sound source stops, you loose the signal connection between the headset and the transmitter and BANG...  LOUD STATIC!!!  Wow... it scares the crap out of you. You then must turn off the sound source (TV, receiver etc) and turn it back on to re-establish the connection to the headset.If the TV program you are watching goes silent (like during a quiet scene in a movie), or a few seconds of silence when the program goes to commercial break, or if listening to a quite passage in a piece of music... or the delay that occurs between music tracks on a record album... BANG ... The headset drops the connection to the transmitter and you get blasted with full volume static. This also happens if you hit the mute button for the TV! What a poor design!NET: Anytime, for any reason, that no sound is being transmitted... the headset thinks the TV or the signal to the transmitter has been shut off and the headset disconnects itself from the circuit. You then have to shut off the TV (or our sound source) and turn it back on to reset the headphones.I own several pairs of wired Sennheiser headphones and love them. Sennheiser makes awesome headphones but every once in a while, every manufacturer turns out a lemon and this unit happens to be Sennheisers.Do yourself a big favor and \"sort\" the Amazon reviews on this product by rating, then read all the One Star reviews.

So certainly, I tested the most popular complaint which is the auto-shut off feature, which turns off the transmitter base and leaves the listener with loud static. First of all, it is not loud static because these headphones DO NOT have the power to blast your ears as some reviewers commented. It does startle you a bit if you've been listening to silence for several minutes. But it does not blast your ears at all. One fact nobody mentioned is that the transmitter will wait for about 3 minutes of silence before it shuts off, which is plenty of time for most situations. Some reviewers made it seem like it would shut off immediately after it detected silence. Obviously, if you're going to be using these headsets with a computer it could be a problem. In that case, I would use a wired headset because when you are browsing the internet on a computer, you could spend a long time without hearing a sound. So think carefully what you're going to be using these headsets for before you buy them.Now for a bit of critique: In 2011, don't you think that technology is advanced enough to have implemented at least an auto-silence feature so that when the transmitter shuts off, it mutes the headphone? I mean FM auto-mute is an 1980's technology that even some car radios had back then to mute the FM static when no signal is being received. But anyway, on to my next item.Along with the auto-shut off feature many people hate (which I find to be no problem at all), some complained that after the transmitter shut off, if you started sending audio to the transmitter base again, the transmitter did not turn back on. This is totally false. If you spend a whole 3 minutes listening to dead air silence and the transmitter shuts off, when the transmitter begins to receive audio again it will turn back on automatically and the headset will receive the audio again. However, what I found disturbing is why doesn't the headset turn off after it stops receiving the signal from the transmitter? I waited a whole 5 minutes after the transmitter shut off listening to FM static and the headset never shut off. If I was a manufacturer of quality products, I would've considered that.Onto more positive things. For most listening occasions, these headsets will deliver crisp, full range audio with punchy bass. I was very pleased with the sound quality. However, if you are a DJ, don't expect these are going to be loud enough for you. I did find that you could easily make the bass distort as the headset itself is not powerful enough for me (I am a DJ). But for most occasions, (watching TV, listening to music in the quiet, etc.) these will do fine, though. What I found is you need to be careful with the audio input to the base. If it is too loud, you may get distortion (which is natural), and if it is not loud enough, you may hear some hissing in the background. So for those of you complaining about hissing, check to make sure your source is loud enough. I am using the headphone output from my home stereo so I can control the audio level going to the base. One nice thing though is that the base will automatically level the sound for you. If the incoming audio is low, the base will automatically amplify the audio level being transmitted to the headset. If you suddenly increase the audio level going to the base, it will automatically level it down to keep the same consistent level for you. Nice feature! I did not find that these feature dampened the dynamic range though, so your audio contrast between loud and soft sounds is nicely maintained.I can't comment much on the battery life as I just got these, but I will probably update on that in the future. But about the signal range, I find it to be very powerful. Very minor static when walking around which is normal for FM communications, but I can go to the backyard without a problem, but why would I need to do that when I can't see my TV from there?Another thing, I find wearing them for a long time to be no problem. They are very comfortable and the open design is not a problem at all. Some people complained about the open design allowing for ambient noise to contaminate the audio experience, but to be honest, once I was listening to something I could not notice any distracting ambient noise.One last thing, I find that the volume control and frequency tuning controls are hard to find by touch while wearing the headset. I guess I might get used to that in the future, but I always find myself struggling looking all around the area where I think they are with my hands until I find them. Same thing with the power switch. Other than that, these are fine headsets that I find most people will be pleased with.

These headphones are very comfortable.As far as specs, you can get a good assessment of the product from reading the Amazon description so I won't go into that.For portable devices with a headphone jack, you simply have to purchase a \"2-RCA (female) to headphone jack (male 3.5mm plug) adapter\". Make sure the adapter is a \"stereo\" adapter versus a \"mono\" adapter. They look exactly the same, so beware. These adapters are pretty inexpensive.I was a little concerned about getting wireless headphones because of all the negative reviews I've read regarding sound quality, interference, etc.Sound quality and hissing can be minimized if you set up properly. Here's a quick \"What to do\":Portable Players (i.e. CD, MP3, Walkman, etc):1) If the device comes with an output other than the headphone jack, use it. This other output (line-out) is usually a jack that delivers a constant, high (i.e. loud) signal. Regardless of your headphone volume level, this jack will output at a constant, strong, loud signal. These line-out jacks are usually found on the back of some CD players.2) If the device only comes with a headphone jack, set the volume to max or near max. This is the setup I'm using. These headphones were bought primarily to be use at work, so I can listen to my iPod wirelessly.NOTE!!! If you're connected to a dedicated home amp/receivers/etc... DO NOT crank the volume all the way up or even remotely close to it. (The line out on your home amp/receiver will transmit a strong, clear signal regardless of the volume setting, if you're connected to the receiver/amp's line-out)The volume should be set high ONLY for smaller, portable devices that output less power such as an MP3 player or handheld portable CD player. You've been warned;-)Why set the signal coming from your unit as high as possible? It significantly reduces the background noise, since the signal being transmitted is strong. You won't need to turn up the volume on your headset as high since the signal being transmitted is strong. Yes, your portable music player will use up power faster, but who cares? Use a power adapter for your device.If your signal wasn't strong, you would need to increase the headset volume which also increases the level of background hiss. Try it out. I would speculate that a lot of these reviews, which complain of unbearable hissing, are a result of their device's volume level being set low.Hope this info helps. Enjoy the headphones...

The rotating barrel wouldn't allow me to zoom smoothly. Imagine dragging a stick along the sidewalk and feeling the \"click\" every time you hit those scored lines in between the poured concrete.  That's what zooming in/out of this lens felt like.On the plus side, even though I bought the lens used on what I will call an \"unnamed auction website,\" Canon fixed the problem without charging me.  I told them it was under warranty, and they didn't question it.  +1 for Canon tech support.  Obviously, YMMV.--End Update--I finally decided that with the price drop on the used DO lenses that I'd plump down $820 for a used DO lens figuring that folks who own high-end stuff like this probably baby them anyway.Summary: it's a _great_ telephoto lens that's very practical. . . depending one what you do.Who it's not for:Studio photographers with strobes can do the same with less $.  In fact, any strobist's image can do just as well with a standard (non-L) lens, or better with the L lenses.  Since the flash is already \"freezing\" the image, there's little advantage in the studio to having DO or IS.  As a portrait lens, it works, but it doesn't work any better than a standard EF.  For the same price, you can get a higher contrast L lens.Who will like it:Travel and vacation photographers will appreciate the ability to zoom WAY longer than any other light-weight zoom lens while still being able to crop back to 70mm.  The ability to go on excursions without depending on a tripod is a HUGE plus.  As an example, I remember visiting a few places in Murano, Italy where tripods were strictly prohibited and lighting was abysmal for the hand-holders.  Needless to say, all of my shots were either blurry or noisy (in a bad way) when using my standard lens.Who will love it:All of you supposed photojournalists who like to \"f/8 and forget it\" pretty much need this lens.  Photojournalist coverage seems to be the latest trend in wedding photography, a style that emphasizes composition and candid personality over staged, technical quality (of a strobist).  This lens empowers the photojournalist to slyly maneuver into various positions to get THE SHOT, especially in difficult real-time situations when you can not hit the rewind button and try again. . . like in weddings.Technical testing:I tested this lens and benchmarked against my tried and true EF 35-105 f3.5-4.5.  I was in a controlled studio setting photographing a brown wicker chair with a shiny silk pillow and a copy of the Economist (they have lots of charts with small lines).  I set the strobes and took a reading with my Sekonic L-358: ISO 100, f8.0; a great test for you photojournalists.Using a Canon 10D and a pan-tilt tripod, I took two series of images, 70mm f8 and 100mm f8.  I captured Large/fine jpgs and imported into Photoshop.  I visually inspected the images for contrast and aberration.  There was absolutely NO visible difference even at 200% magnification.HOWEVER, there is one very noticeable difference between the lenses.  Something in the DO glass is slowing down the lens.  The histogram confirms that the DO images are somehow darker than the non-DO images by almost exactly 1/3 stop.  Naturally, I go back and recapture the image on my DO lens at f7.1 and voila - perfect exposure. So, maybe the new rule for photojournalists with this lens is to \"f7.1 and forget it.\"Conclusion:Before we're tempted to knock the lens for being too slow, losing a 1/3 stop, not having clarity of the L lenses for the same price, etc.  Let's remember that this is a specialty lens with a purpose.  It's a portable lens that has all the clarity of a standard lens while offering a MUCH wider focal range.  Will you see sports photographers using this?  They would be stupid to do so.  Commercial photographers are the same.  At the same time, you'll be hard pressed to find a wedding photographer lugging around a 70-200/2.8L.  Who wants to be the idiot setting up a tripod in the middle of the aisle while bride and groom are taking vows?To make this lens even more useful, I'm planning to pick up a used EOS 1ds.  It's an older full-frame DSLR that's finally dropped to an affordable price.  The 1.6x crop factor on the 10D and similar SLRs make it harder to \"fit\" some images into such a tight frame.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Great if you like to f/8 and forget it, or f7.1 with this lens...

It doesn't stick out in a crowd, at least until you rack it out with the hood on.It was one of the early choices when I decided to move up to SLR Digital from other types -- and the old reliable 35mm SLRs.I'd buy it again and I plan to use it on a 5D when it arrives, for a trip with me and the 20D, This is core travel lens for me. As for quality, it's very good. I own some Ls, but this dances in the same league. I was a professional who cut his teeth on Nikon Fs (and used other cameras up to 8x10). I've used optics from Leica to Nikon to Goerz. If your images aren't sharp, consider that it may be user error.I mostly use autofocus, but frequently switch to manual and it fits the hand well either way. The balance is good.I don't see the softness at 300mm others refer to, but typically there are sweet spots of f stop and focal length with zooms. Every lens has some inherent compromise -- fast or slow, fat or slim. I don't observe any softness, but I shoot only in RAW and do image processing outside the camera. JPGs are useful or unavoidable in places, but pointless if RAW is available.I do large prints 13x19 or larger and the image holds together as well as anything else I've used.FWIW, in the first few days I owned this lens, I shot a long series on sea birds feeding -- and the images contained details I couldn't see clearly while shooting (more common than admitted). But the smooth zoom and auto focus made composition on moving objects easy. The camera lens combination was perfect. Better equipment does not makes you a better photographer, but it can help a good one. The image stablization is very good.

I own the Canon 24-105mm L (outstanding), the 100mm Macro L (superb), and the DO (fantastic).  This trinity meets or exceeds all of my needs.  You will be very happy with the DO, and you might find that you use it more than any other lens in your arsenal.  It's expensive, but what lens of sufficient quality and versatility isn't?

I tried the 100-400mm and loved it, but found it just too long and too heavy for normal use. I tried the Sigma 150-500mm, but it was even longer than the Canon 100-400mm. I also tried the 70-300mm USM IS (non-DO) lens, but did not like the length of that lens either, so I ended up buying this lens. There are a lot of things I like about this lens.1. It is short. It is, in fact, shorter, when closed, than my 18-200mm lens and a little easier to carry.2. Even with the lens extended to 300mm, it is still relatively short. Especially if the lens hood is either reversed or removed from the lens.3. The lens has a locking mechanism to keep it from extending when just walking around.4. The pictures, out to about 250mm, are clear and crisp.5. The colors are vibrant and true.6. The USM is quiet and quick.But there are also what I see as some shortcomings.1. Pictures taken at above 250mm or so are a little soft. I mounted the camera and lens on a tripod, set the mirror lock-up and attached a remote release. But even with all of that the photos at 300mm are a little soft when viewed above 50% magnification. And, of course, pictures that I took at 300mm hand held also had some camera movement as well as being a little soft. This makes it difficult to get good pictures by cropping something small out of the photos.2. It is heavier than the non-DO version (25.4 vs. 22.2 oz).3. I found that I had a more difficult time holding my camera steady with this lens than the 100-400mm that I tried earlier. I assume that is because the lens is short and cannot easily be held from both front and back to steady it.4. As other reviewers have written, the lens lock switch is not accessible when the lens hood is mounted reversed. Since I keep the lens hood mounted all the time, this means that I cannot lock it when I put it into my camera bag.5. It is an expensive lens.But, even with all of the shortcomings I am happy with this lens. The pictures, even out to 300mm, are good and I saw the same softness in the non-DO version as in this one. Since this lens is so short, and the throw is not great, it is easy for me to forget that the lens is extended to 300mm. If I carry my monopod with me, or use a tripod, the softness is not visible unless the photo is viewed above 50-75%. And, perhaps most importantly, the lens is easy to carry and so I will be able to use it when walking in the National Parks. I would have rated this lens as 5 stars instead of 4 had the photos been sharper at 300mm. I think that this is an expensive lens and, for the price, expected sharpness throughout the range. It is not an L lens, but the price is close and I thought the picture quality should be as high everywhere in its range.UPDATED 10/3/2010:A week ago I replaced my Canon 500D with a new 7D. I had not expected that changing my camera would have had any effect on the quality of the images from this lens, but it certainly did. Before, as I wrote, the images taken above 250mm were a little soft, even when taken with a tripod and mirror-lockup. But all of that seems to have gone away when this lens was mounted on the new 7D. Images all the way out to 300mm are now clear and sharp. The color and clarity, always good, are in no way diminished on the 7D.I can only attribute the change to the ability of the 7D to focus more accurately than my copy of the 500D. Perhaps that is an innate problem with the 500D or perhaps my copy just was out of wack somehow. In any case this lens now produces very sharp photos for me and I am very happy with it.I tried to change the rating of this lens from 4 stars to 5, but the Amazon software did not reflect the change, so I will say again - mounted on my new 7D this lens is very sharp. Add to that the fact that this lens is short and easier to handle than the 70-300 IS (non-DO) version and the result is a combination that I am very happy to have.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "I like this lens", "unixReviewTime": 1277942400, "reviewTime": "07 1, 2010"}

I also recently purchased a 5D MkII, so any praise I may have for the lens may be partly due to this camera. When I read some reviews of this lens, I was worried that it was weird. I will mostly address these issues.  Is it heavy? No. I use a monopod and hand carry a 100-400 lens without problems. This lens is only 52 mm at the front,so it has amazing reach for its size.  Does the zoom feel heavy? No.  The zoom needs some resistance, since the front of the lens would extend by itself if it was too light on the zoom control.  This is the same issue you have with the Sigma 18-200, another great all purpose lens for candid shots. Both lenses have a lock button that keeps the lens from extending when you not taking pictures.Lastly and most importantly does the diffraction type lens cause any problems? No. I have literaly seen no problems with lack of sharpness or unusual flare. I think you would have to shoot  tripod test scenes to reveal this. Using a monopod in real life conditions,the issue does not appear to exist. Admitedly with back ligthting you can get some fogginess and flare,but this is just like other lenses.

It has controls for every aspect of picture-taking that I could ever want to adjust. The commonly used functions are usually only a button press or two away rather than buried in the menu system.The movie mode is quite useful rather than just a gimmick. I can definitely see myself leaving my camcorder at home in situations where movie-taking opportunities will be few and far between.My D-460Z supports alignment guides for panoramas (when using Olympus-branded flash cards), but I'm blown away by the PowerShot S1 IS's \"Stitch Assist\" implementation. For every shot after the first, you are presented with a dimmed version of the overlapping one-third of the previous shot with which to align your next shot.I really like that this camera uses standard AA cells. It will save me a fortune on extra battery sets vs. the Li-ion batteries used in several other digicams.I wish Canon had opted for a USB 2.0 or Firewire interface because the files -- movies, especially -- take forever to download over USB 1.1. This fact did not detract from my rating because I find the workaround to be perfectly acceptable: a USB 2.0 or Firewire CompactFlash reader.I do have a couple of nit-picky focus-related complaints. First of all, I find the autofocus to be very problematic in incandescent room light, which leads to many out-of-focus shots because even the manual focus is difficult to use in that light.

These recharge in 15 minutes and last a long time.The features on this camera are great for beginners and the more advanced.  For beginners you can use all the automatic settings and it does a great job.  For the advanced you have shutter or aperture priority settings as well as manual settings so you can do some creative things.  You can change the ISO from 50 to 400 based on lighting.

I have not experienced any problems, but it is possible to adjust flash output if pictures seen to be over-exposed, as some complained.At maximun zoom, unless you're using a high shutter speed, the image stabilization is not enough to compensate for movement.

Now you'd like something with a few more manual controls.I'm not going to repeat what's in many other reviews here (an amazing 10x stabilized zoom ... you'll find it difficult to move back to a camera without this, generally excellent photo quality, and really compact - HOW do they fit this all in such a tiny package??) but instead I'd like to point out a few aspects of the camera that haven't been discussed that much in other reviews here.1. Get yourself a basic book on digital photography, so you will actually use some of the manual features of this camera. A $15 investment will give you better photo results within 30 minutes. Guaranteed. I got myself \"Digital Photography Pocket Guide\" from Amazon and I can already see the results in my photos.2. You'll love taking photos by using the viewfinder and not the LCD screen (which, at 1.5\", seems dismally small for a camera such as this) - the viewfinder is full of (though not cluttered with) details of your shot. Aperture, resolution, etc.3. The zoom control is tricky and takes time to get used to. A slight flick of the control and you have quickly moved beyond 5x magnification. You'll get the hang of it quickly, but be forewarned that you will be frustrated using the zoom initially.4. while other reviews have commented on using the Sandisk Ultra II card for taking VGA movies, I'm a little perplexed. While the movies are recorded on the card just fine, transferring them to my 2.4 gigahertz P4 machine leads to loss of data in the transfer and I am unable to view them properly. I am convinced there is an issue with the file transfer speed related to the camera's mechanism, NOT the memory card - for I have tried multiple ones. If you are buying this camera purely for this reason, do check this out carefully so that you too don't deal with the same problems (besides, the 512 MB card allows barely two minutes of 640x480 video.)5. The battery meter, which comes on only when the batteries are about to run out, could be better and indicate the approximate number of shots left. Come on Canon, you can do better...All in all, these are small deficiencies, certainly not glaring. I'm pleased with my stabilized zoom camera choice (the Panasonic FZ series were too bulky, the Minolta Dimage Z series too plastic feeling).One last point.

It arrived even before Amazon said it would!  This is my first digital camera and so far I am very pleased with it.  I wanted a camera that would take good travel pictures and images of grandchildren who often don't like cameras near them.  I expect to print the better pictures as either 4x6 or 5x7 and occasionally 8x10s.  At first I was reluctant to consider 3.2MP cameras but my research showed that a figure of merit for a digital camera should actually be proportional to MP times the optical zoom factor squared.  This gives a heavy weighting to optical zoom (it's related to picture area) and it also means that you can avoid considerable cropping and wasting of MP.  That's why people are often surprised that this camera does so well against its higher MP competition.  It's also adequate for printing my size pictures. Unfortunately, most hand held 10X cameras used at maximum zoom also need to have a shutter speed of 1/400th of a second to avoid picture bluring caused by camera shake so that you can use this 10X feature only in bright sunlight, unless you support the camera.  The Canon S1's image stabilization system allows hand held pictures with much slower shutter speeds so it is useful more often.  I always leave it on and I've taken sharp pictures of ducks, birds, and, oh yes, our grandchildren at a playground.  Our daughter, who is a professional photographer, has even commented on the quality of these candid shots, something she did not do with my film camera with lower power zoom.  Independently, I also purchased a lightweight RipVan100 battery charger that can operate at overseas voltages and I carry around an extra set of charged NIMH AA batteries, just in case, although I've yet to need them.  Of course, in a pinch, I can always use universally available AA batteries, another feature of this camera.This camera, like all 10X zooms, uses an electronic viewfinder.  I find that it is hard to see well in bright sunlight (especially if I'm wearing sunglasses), even at maximum brightness setting.  Its resolution is also poor and the images often seem overexposed - but, and this is important, the images don't shake at 10X with the IS on! and the actual pictures are correctly exposed. The swiveling LCD screen grows on you and you can take pictures looking down at the camera at waist level.  The grandchildren may not even realize you are actually taking their picture, adding to the candid effect. I haven't found the lack of an autofocusing lamp to be a problem in dim light and you can always set the manual focus to about 8 feet (no zoom used) and everything from 4 feet to infinitity will be sharp.  (I got this tidbit from my research).After it was announced but before it was readily available the camera received so-so reviews but the recent user reviews from those who actually own and use one have been highly favorable and I agree with them.  It's well made, not too heavy, and the basics can be learned quickly.  Advanced users can find many features to investigate and I'm still learning how to use some of the exposure and focus lock modes for special cases.  I think that using the Auto mode (or the Program P mode) with IS on will work for most people, most of the time.  And, as an added bonus, you can even take movies (9 minutes/1GB at best quality) if you have a large memory.

I really like this camera, and here is why:1) It has an \"Auto\" mode so that my wife and kids can use it without worrying about flash, f-stops and shutter speeds.  OK, almost all digitals do this.  ;-)2) But, you can change to Program AE, Tv, Av or fully manual mode.  Now we're talkin'!  I'm all for point and shoot ease when it comes to family snapshots, but sometimes I like to get creative with a sunset, moonrise, night shot, fill-flash, silhouette, etc. and this camera can handle it.  It's got up to a 15-second shutter, which is longer than many in this class.3) You can add narration comments to photos, which I find handy when documenting something that the picture alone does not explain.  Like, I do genealogy photos so I want to say who lived there or whose grave marker that was, or whatever.  You can download the comments to the computer as a WAV file as well.  It's like taking notes while you're recording the scene.4) Movie mode is *almost* a replacement for my Sony Digital8 camcorder.  Other than the camcorder recording in stereo and having better low-light sensitivity, the Powershot S1 can handle most of what I use a camcorder for.  Image stabilization and zoom while recording are bonuses in this camera class.5) No lens swapping any more.  With the 10x zoom from 38mm to 380mm, there's no need to carry any lenses with it, although you can get a wider wide angle and a longer telephoto, but why?  If you're that into photography, you should be looking at digital SLRs anyway.6) Vari-angle LCD makes it so much easier to get an angle that you can't when the LCD is attached.  Shoot over your head, from your feet, around a corner...  not many cameras in this class can do that.7) Stitch Assist mode.  OK, this was a feature I liked in particular that you may not care about.  But I like to take panoramas, and with the T70, I was guessing how much overlap I had, what the exposure should be for each shot, etc.  With the Powershot S1, it locks in white balance and exposure on the first frame, then shows you 1/3 of the last frame in the next shot so you can line them up.  I can do hand-held panoramas all day!  :-)OK, so there were a few negatives that I'll share too:1) There's no hot shoe for my Vivitar flash, although you can buy a Canon flash unit for this model.  But I probably won't because I think the built-in ~15 ft. flash range will be all I need.2) Speaking of that... flash pictures that you take from about 5 feet and closer seem to be washed out in the highlights.  That may be because the sensor is reading the dark background and overcompensating.  But you can manually adjust the flash power, which I set to about 1/4 on the scale and that seems to cure the problem for close ups.3) A low-light focusing lamp would help.  I had some trouble on Halloween eve focusing outdoors with natural light.4) I think I like the pre-flash type of red-eye reduction rather than the little LED light that's on this camera.  It doesn't seem to take care of red-eye in all cases (like when people are not looking directly at the camera), but it works OK in most cases.I believe the newer Powershot S2 takes care of some of these issues, but then again, it's almost 2x as expensive at this point in time.When you buy this camera, you will need a case and a memory card for it.  I bought the Tamrac 5693 Digital 3 Bag here on Amazon, which fits the S1, an extra set of batteries, an extra memory card, and the camera's video cable.  I've heard that the Canon PSC-70 bag is on the small side for this camera.  The memory card I bought (here on Amazon again) was the SanDisk SDCFH-512-901 512MB Ultra II CompactFlash Card, which has plenty of space for what I need and is a pretty fast card.One other thing you'll probably want to buy is some NiMH batteries.  I didn't have a charger either, so I bought a package of 8 2500ma Energizer batteries and a nice Powerex MH-C204W charger for about $50 at [...]I came away with this whole setup for about $375, which I think was a great deal and well worth the convenience and quality that I got.  I considered the Panazsonic Lumix DMC-FZ4 too, but I liked the Canon features and the fact that it used cheaper AA batteries and CF card.

The zoom is more than you get with most cameras, and having a viewfinder is a must if you like to shoot outdoors in bright light. There's even a vision adjustment on the viewfinder. You may have read criticism of the lens cap. If you read the manual, you will see that it's meant to attach to the neck strap, so you really don't have to worry about losing the cap as some reviews state. I would prefer, however, a more secure snap on cover.As we all know, the proof is in the pictures, and Canon is still delivering the goods. I immediately set out to shoot a little bit of everything. In my opinion, one of the hardest shots to get perfect with point and shoot is indoors at night with inconsistent ambient lighting. I used the low light option on the dial, and I was really impressed. The shots I took were very evenly lit and the flash hadn't overexposed my subjects. I took a picture of an outdoor scene through an indoor window using the zoom. The picture looked like it had been shot outdoors rather than from inside. I took a picture during the day in a well lit room with no flash and it was beautiful.If you buy this camera, do yourself a favor and spend an hour going through the manual. You will find out how easy it is to control the many options, so you will be more apt to use them. I even liked the manual design. There are separate manuals in Spanish and English, so you can dispose of the one you don't need.I know I will be happy with this camera for years to come. Some of Canon's cameras have become legendary in the photo world and still have an active life on Ebay years after their retirement. I believe this is one of those cameras.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The perfect camera for novice and professional alike", "unixReviewTime": 1113004800, "reviewTime": "04 9, 2005"}

Lucio \"juannyc\"", "helpful": [47, 51], "reviewText": "My experiences with Canon cameras have been excellent, and so far they achieve the best picture quality and best colors. Solid feel, portability, good ergonomics, simple menus, good software and attractive styling are features that Canon cameras have and I like, and the S1 IS, for the most part, is no exception.So why do I give it 3 stars?Simply put: IT DOES NOT FOCUS EFFECTIVELY IN LOW LIGHT CONDITIONS.  I feel this fact has been glossed over by many other reviewers. Just about all digital Canon cameras I know of have an Automatic Focus Assist Light or Illuminator. (A little beam of light projected by the camera so that it can achieve a rapid and sharp focus in difficult or low light conditions). The Canon Supershot S1 IS does NOT have an AF Illuminator. This omission makes it tough to shoot indoors, at least for me. Some say it takes longer, and yes sometimes it does, but often it just doesn't focus at all, especially when zoomed in on people. Perhaps I have been spoiled with my trusty Canon Powershot S100 camera (with an AF illuminator); it does an excellent job in low light and indoors.AN AF ASSIST LIGHT SHOULD BE AN ALL DIGITAL CAMERAS! I was \"iffy\" about buying this camera for that reason, but the reviews gave me the impression that this was not an issue. However it is an issue that one should be aware of, hence my review.Although you can focus manually (and very well too), and it has an automatic focusing bracketing feature, trying to get a spontaneous shot of someone indoors, at a party or at dusk becomes easier said than done. It will focus better on a still object or shooting with a wide angle in a dim setting.There are so many pluses of this camera; I won?t elaborate since other reviewers have detailed them rather well. My favorite is the variable speed and nearly silent zoom, which can be zoomed slowly during the excellent movie mode. It is also very fast to zoom to the full 10x with virtually no blurred images (handheld, with out a tripod) thanks to the built in Image Stabilization. This blurry image at 10x issue was a problem I had with my previous camera (Olympus C-740).I know that one digital camera can't do it all (at least not yet), but if the Supershot S1 IS could focus well in low light, then I would then say this one does it all. If you want an outdoor camera, or don't plan to take a lot \"happy snappies\" of friends and family indoors, then this camera is for you. For now it looks like I?ll just carry both of my Canons!PS: Unless you are going to be making huge prints (larger than 8 x 10) the 3.2 Megapixel resolution is more than adequate for most users. I would like 4 Megapixel... but that is not a deal breaker for me.UPDATE: 11/15/04Well I did find the camera that so far appears to do it all, the Nikon Coolpix 8800. It is amazing, and I recommend it as an alternative, worth the extra money! Focuses quickly in low light, and does have AF light as well as Vibration Reduction, 10 x Zoom, great movie mode and an excellent lens.UPDATE: 08/20/05Looks like Canon listened, the new Canon PowerShot S2 IS does have an AF assist lamp!", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Good, but not in low light conditions - No AF Assist  : (", "unixReviewTime": 1086998400, "reviewTime": "06 12, 2004"}

The diopter on the viewfinder is another unique feature that this bi-focaled person appreciates. Adjust it to your vision and images are focused perfectly in the viewfinder. The LCD screen can be flipped in different positions, which is handy.  Bonus: fold it down to keep it from getting scratched and full of fingerprints. It's a tad smaller than I'm accustomed to, but suffices.  The pop-up flash is handy, and again, is less likely to get damaged when down.

It allows for manual control of all settings (ISO, focus, shutter, aperature, exposure compensation, white balance, etc). Manual control over these settings makes for FUN photography (things maybe you never played with much on a 35mm because of film costs). The camera feels really wonderful in my hand; I could never get used to the pocket sized digital cameras, this has a pro-like grip, and the body is a very comfortable size (smaller than a pro SLR, but bigger than the average point and shoot digital camera).A few things that I don't like about the camera so far:While you can adjust focus manually, it's all done within the digital display via button pushing. I'd much prefer adjusting focus physically (ie by turning the lense fixture).  Some digital cameras allow for this.Movie mode delivers spectacular quality videos! but I found adjusting focus while shooting movies can be impossible (it appears you must rely on auto focus in movie mode). Virtually every setting is configured automatically in movie mode, which makes movies something I will avoid with this camera (but I didn't expect to get a video camera anyway, so not a big con here).The USB connection to the PC from the camera uses a special connector on the camera. This connection is very small, and it is difficult to insert the USB wire into it. I'm afraid something might break if this connection is used often. A Compact Flash card reader might be the best solution here, but that puts extra wear on your memory card :\\No AC adapter included ... only a 32MB Compact Flash card included (which will only hold something like 20 images on the highest quality setting).Overall, I am very happy with this camera as my first digital camera.

Kane", "helpful": [58, 60], "reviewText": "I've had this camera for about a year now and overall I'm still quite happy with my purchase. The drawbacks to this camera are common with all digital models I've tried and the picture quality is quite exceptional. Here's some more details...First the pros: It's very ergonomic, well-designed, and easy to use, even for first time digital camera owners like me. The 10x zoom works smoothly and very well. In good light the auto focus locks on quickly and the pictures turn out great, even when blown up as large as 8x10. With the right paper in the printer I cannot tell the difference quality-wise between these pix and my old film camera. I really like the flip out monitor screen for shooting pictures over crowds (e.g., at sporting events). It's very visible except in harsh, direct sunlight. The image stabilization works well, eliminating the need for a tripod in most situations. Sports mode gives clear action shots even when your subject is moving quickly. The self-timer is a nice feature too. Images are easy to download to the PC (with XP you don't even need the software that comes with the camera). The built in flash works better than I expected (up to ~10' away anyway).Now the cons: In low light situations the camera is extremely challenging to use. First off, the viewfinder is electronic and you cannot see what you are aiming at through it or the LCD monitor. In night or auto mode close-up pictures come out okay, you just have to guess at your aim. Longer shots do not work out well at all. At my son's Christmas concert last night I snapped 43 shots. 5 turned out well and 2 more were usable. The rest were garbage. Anytime the kids moved at all, the shot turned out blurry no matter what mode I had it set on (and I tried several), even with a tripod. This was extremely frustrating!! Further, like most digital cameras there is a significant delay between when you push the button and when the picture is actually snapped. It is very hard to take sports shorts unless you get lucky with timing or use the movie mode.Other stuff: you'll want to purchase a larger memory card. 32mb just doesn't cut it. I went with 256 and have been very happy. You also want to purchase some rechargeable batteries. This thing takes 4 AA's and really chews them up fast, especially when you are using the monitor and zooming a lot. Be sure to use the lens cap strap. It's designed to slide off when the camera is turned on (a convenience?) yet it tends to fall off at odd times since it does not snap in place. Don't buy the Cannon camera bag. It is poorly designed and overpriced.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Very good but flawed", "unixReviewTime": 1103241600, "reviewTime": "12 17, 2004"}

My favorite type of photography is \"nature\", especially birds.  I used to mainly use a Nikon N90S with various lenses and such.  But that gets heavy and hot in the Everglades.I have been using the S1 now a month or two.  I absolutely love it.  The zoom power is wonderful for that long bird shot.  You lose some resolution using the digital zoom though, but that's expected.  It's a light camera but you can still handhold long shots thanks to the image stabilization.  I use a monopod most of the time now.It's almost like an SLR, with the digital viewfinder!  Using the back screen that most cameras have is difficult in bright sunlight.  The digital viewfinder in the S1 is still a minor difficulty in bright sunlight, but very usable.  All the functions are pushbutton, and settings visible in both screen and viewfinder.Functions at this price level are amazing.  I am very very happy with available options.  It has a \"one button preset\" where you can set one button to do a chosen function.  I use that button for setting ISO speed.I use a UV filter all the time with the special adapter.  Beautiful outdoor shots.Macro capability is very good.The S1 is not cheap...but it tries very hard to be a digital SLR.

I have my own website and pics are fine.  3.2megapixels is ok.  I think more sensor resolution must be coupled with better optics, otherwise no point in a 6mp camera with plastic lenses.  So the S1 is fine in this respect.  Good optics, adequate sensor.Battery life is good.  Some complain about battery life.  I find it good with 2200mah Nimh rechargables.  But those who complain don't realize the first few times you use a rechargable battery the battery only has limited capacity....so it ain't the camera, it's the battery.  If you get new batteries, charge them up and stick them in a flash light and discharge them like this a few times.  Then you will get good battery life in camera.I gave the S1 5 stars.  It deserves them.If you don't need all the features or long zoom, try the outstand \"A\" series by Canon.  The A75 is a great value.

We've had digital cameras for years now and we've had quite an assortment.  Everyone, in our family, has one.My personal favorite, is the digital rebel.  I know you're asking, why is she reviewing this camera then?  Easy!  I wanted a camera that I could easily whip out and capture a shot with... but I didn't want the tiny handheld ones.  I wanted something that felt comfortable, in my hand.... yet.. wasn't heavy.  I was also looking for zoom.This camera fits that bill, perfectly! and at a great price too!To start, this camera runs on 4 AA batteries.  Usually, that's a turn off for me, but I picked up some 2300 mhz batteries and I can easily get 500+ shots out of a charge of those, w/ the LCD and the flash on.  With the batteries, this baby weights, about a pound.  While that may seem heavy, compared to the little tiny cameras and cell phones that are avialable these days.. Let me tell you.  That's not heavy.  It's got a great neck strap and the camera carrys comfortably on that, around your neck,  w/out weighing you down.The 10x zoom is real nice!  Now, I'm only using optical zoom, otherwise, with the digital kicked in, it would be a 30x.  I just rely on the optical.  This camera takes some VERY nice pictures with that zoom.  A picture worthy of the Canon name!  And you can capture such a nice picture because of the IS (image stabilization) that is built into this camera.  You will notice little (or no) camera shake when you have it fully zoomed in on something.  Admittedly, it seemed like it, with the first couple test shots I took.  I was looking through the viewfinder, aiming at something down the street.. and it seemed like I was waivering all over the place.  But when I downloaded the pictures.  I was VERY pleased.  Crystal clear!I have the found, that some cameras have terrible color saturation, w/ the picture right out of the camera.  This isn't one of them.  With the default settings, the blues (sky, water) are rich, tonal, and dimentional.  There's no red problems, when shooting reds, that I've noticed.  Sometimes reds will bleed out .. or not appear true.. and that's simply not the case.Indoor pictures.. I'll be honest.. W/ the built in flash, this little camera, kicks my $1K camera's behind!  The flash doesn't tend to wash out the subject (on the default settings).. skin tones are exactly what they are.  Little or no adjustments are needed, in my book.This camera is fast to start up, and write, to the CF card that it uses (buy a bigger CF card!).  It's got auto controls for those that don't want to think.  For those that want to learn a bit more about photography, it's got the F stops, and all that jazz..ALONG WITH...the ability to change your focal point.  You're not stuck in the middle of the frame.  If you want your subject off to the left of the frame..and the rest to be 'soft'... That's not a problem.  With a simple push of the button, your point of focus changes.I can go on.. but I'm sure you have the idea, after reading all these reviews.This is a great camera for the money.  While you maybe taking a step down, in megapixels, you're gaining the zoom ability.  The decrease in the megapixels, I feel, are not that noticible.In fact, this camera has all the features that I was looking for, in my higher end cameras. .. but for a fraction of the price.i wouldn't think twice about recommending this camera to anyone.

THE CAMERA DIED WHILE PROPERLY STORED IN ITS CASE WITH THE BATTERIES REMOVED.  IT NEVER WAS DROPPED.  IT JUST PLAIN DIED.  HAVING RECEIVED NO ABUSE WHATSOEVER, THE CAMERA'S DEMISE MEANS EITHER PLANNED OBSOLESCENCE OR CRUMMY CONSTRUCTION.  EITHER WAY, I'LL NOT BUY ANOTHER CANON SINCE I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE TO HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS.  I'VE DROPPED IT FROM 4 STARS FOR ITS SLUGGISHNESS TO 1 STAR FOR ITS POOR VALUE GIVEN ITS EXPECTED LIFE SPAN.While I am delighted by the camera's picture quality, wealth of features, and logic, there are some caveats. But, although this is just a 3.3MP camera, I think the color quality and resolution will satsify all but the perfectionists.The caveats are all really related to the pace of the focusing, especially when the zoom is used. Going from no zoom to a 10X zoom is to wait for a good two to three seconds for the focus to catch up. At first, the zoomed-in on object will be just a blur -- both to the viewfinder and to the picture itself if you opt to shoot before the focus catches up. And, in addition, there is -- zoom or no zoom -- about a second's delay between getting the frame in focus and getting the shot.So, I've taken off a star for the camera's speed. My objection is not about one to three seconds but about the loss of several candid shots you might otherwise enjoy.The other disadvantage is that the camera DOES go through regular batteries rather quickly. However, with rechargeable batteries, the battery life is several times greater tha with disposable batteries and quite good. (I took about 140 shots on vacation and spent a lot of time fiddling around with the camera in between shots without needing to swap out my rechargeable batteries.)If your primary reason for wanting the camera is to shoot animals, sporting events, or small children, it's quite possible that you'll be less satisfied with this camera than I am.On the other hand, there is more to love than the quality and color of the pictures you do catch. The features, which are many, are easy to use once you've read the manual to find which buttons do what. (This is NOT, as a few have written, a difficult camera to learn to use. You can and will be up and running with it in a short time. However, thanks to the wealth of features, the advanced features will take some additional time to learn. This seems reasonable enough to me. Excel is more difficult to use than a calculator and quite difficult to master in all its aspects. That's not because Excel (or this camera) is awkwardly designed. On the contrary, both are very well-designed. Excel is more difficult to MASTER (not use but master) than a calculator because it does so much more. So, of course, MASTERING all the features of this camera will take more time than MASTERING all the features of a disposable camera. Seems fair and logical enough to me.)Some of the features I especially like:- It is a cinch to disable the flash by simply cycling through the flash options afforded by the dial (i.e., \"diopter adjustment dial\") that is located, logically enough, right next to the flash. If you decide to shoot a picture off your TV or to shoot a lit Tiffany lamp at night or to capture just the candles on a birthday cake (and so on and so on), you'll love the ability to turn off the flash.- The default settings for the camera seem very logical -- the highest setting for photo quality, the disabling of the digital zoom, the enabling of the red-eye protection, etc. So, if you can't wait to start shooting, you'll start off with high quality shots and with setting that you'd probably want most of the time. (Your digital zooming can and probably should be done via software after you've captured the highest quality image with the optical zoom. This will give you the option to decide later whether you really want to give up the quality of the image for a closer look. If you use the digital zoom when you shoot, you've given up the option to back off for higher quality. If you decide that you'd rather give up the quality for a closer shot than the 10X optical provided, you'll get the same result via the included editing software.)- Macro photography requires no special setting. However, to avoid overexposed macro shots indoors, you may elect to use the zoom rather than to get right on top of your subject.- The included software provides the option to see what apertures and shutter speeds were used for each shot and whether or not the digital zoom was used. (It doesn't directly tell you whether the optical zoom was used.)- For those not adverse to reading, the Canon documentation is extensive.Final tip:Discover early the diopter ajustment dial next to the immediate left of the viewfinder. This is a focus for the viewfinder. The focus on the viewfinder was not clear until I discovered this little dial. Once adjusted, it has tended to stay adjusted.&lt;P(...)If the MAIN attraction of this camera is the stabilized 10X optical zoom, you might be surprised to find that it becomes the least desireable feature thanks to its slow focus. However, as one who has owned a Nikon and a Fuji in the past, I soon found that the Canon jumped to the head of the list for its picture and color quality -- as well as for its excellent additional features.And, oh yes, the camera is loads of fun. You can spend hours exploring its features and in discovering the advantages of its various modes. In just two days, the camera has me taking shots I've never been able to take before. I haven't mastered the camera, but I've acquainted myself with a host of new (i.e., to me) features already. More important, most of my pictures are coming out great. I can still come up with some duds, but that's not the camera's fault!SUMMARY: The camera is too slow to focus to rely upon for action shots, but -- WOW! -- it's a joy for most purposes.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Camera died after a couple of years -- no apparent reason", "unixReviewTime": 1087603200, "reviewTime": "06 19, 2004"}

This camera has alot of features, and considering how many it has, its very compact.  Some of the features include:10x optical zoom:  This is a very nice zoom range, and it gives you alot of framing flexiblility.Image stablilizer: This is a very good stabilizer, especially for the movie mode.  Also, when you're zoomed in at 10x, it helps you keep the camera steadyManual Focus:  I guess this counts as a feature, but that being said, its not a very good one.  When you zoom in, it wont let you focus under two feet, which isnt very useful.  Also, the auto focus on this camera isnt so great, since it only has one point and doesnt have an AF assist lamp, so focusing right can be really annoying sometimesMovie Mode:  This camera has a GREAT movie mode.  The 30 frames per second really makes the movies look nice, plus the sound quality is better than most digital cameras.  The thing i really like, though, is that you can use the 10x lens to zoom while you're taking movies, just like a camcorder.  Now, the zoom isnt silent while your taking a movie, even if you use it at its \"reduced speed\" for the movie mode.  If you use the zoom's REALLY slow speed, though, it doesnt interfere with sound, so thats not really a problemPanoramas:  This camera helps you take a series of pictures to form a panorama.  It saves them as individual pictures, but the software the camera comes with to stich them is very easy to use and stiches the pictures nicelyTime lapse:  This camera can take time lapse shots; you can take up to 100 pictures, and its a nice mode if you want to make an interesting movieTheres probably alot of other modes i didnt get to, but when you get this camera, youll be trying to figure out all it can do for a long time.  If you dont want that though, this camera has a fully auto mode, which makes it just like a point and shoot.

It's main goal is to try to be a G series camera for 300.00. In this regard it falls short in both speed and sharpness, but not by much. As with all P&S; cameras of any price, the A95 poses quite a few obstacles to the shooter. Focus lag, limited F-stop range, punchy flash are among them. On the other hand it has excellent color balance (a big problem for cameras like the Nikon 8800, ALL Panasonics, Konica Minolta Z5 and so on). Sharpness is average for a camera in this class. For sports, kid photography and any highly critical use, most advanced shooters won't be happy with anything less than a DSLR. I bought the A95 for use on the job and as a backup camera. On the other hand the average shooter will probably LOVE the A95. It's a remarkably well made camera capable of taking great shots with some practice. If you don't need giant prints 11X14 or larger, a camera like the A95 is probably a smarter buy than many of the prosumer units currently available. Also keep in mind that those long zoom cameras do best outdoors in bright light where their contrast based focus systems work well. The A95 works best OUT of it's full auto modes. Learn to use the manual settings and you'll be taking plenty of great pictures. I highly recommend the Canon A95, but do your homework carefully and try one if possible. It's a solid pick for a family camera, enthusiast seeking a well priced starter camera or as a backup for your DSLR.Pros> Superior handling and ergonomics compared to compacts> Reasonably sharp for mid size camera> VG AF system> Bayonet lens system for additional lenses> Nice viewfinder> Great swivel LCD> Easy manual control> Amazing color balance for a P&S;> Excellent macro mode> usable manual focus> Powerful flash> Solidly builtCons> Noise above ISO 100 as with all P&S; is limiting> Focus lag as with all P&S; limits use for getting fast kiddy pics and such.> Dual menu system sucks> Limited F-stop range just like most P&S; cameras> Camera is heavy with 4 AAs> mediocre movie mode> Flash blows highlights in AUTO modes in certain conditions> AF assist should be brighter> No remote option! C'mon!Compared to:The 8800: The Canon can't match the Nikon 8800's quality and lens no way-no-how, but it shoots faster and will get more shots in focus. It also has far better color balance than the 8800 by a royal mile. Outdoors the Canon can't compete at all. Indoors I'd rather shoot with the Canon.The Pentax Optio S5i: The tiny Pentax lens did very well by comparison, but the Canon has the edge for color and sharpness. Pentax had better low light AF, but longer focus lag.The Sony L1: I love the L1. It fails in ergnomics but it's a ultra compact anyway. If not for the memory stick pro I might have bought one. At 199.00 its a steal! The A95 won out due to being able to share my D70 cards.The Nikon D70: The Canon's only advantage over the D70 is it's size. For some applications, the Canon's swivel display might also give it a leg up. The D70 has no movie mode of any kind. Beyond that the D70 simply takes better pics than any P&S;/Prosumer.

The Nikon that I own all have this.  I considered a must-have.  But is it worth an extra hundred that's for you to decide.The camera also has all the extras that make a little more powerful than your standard point-and-shoot. It is aperture priority and shutter priority selection, which is great. If you're new to cameras, shutter speed allows you to control how long the shutter stays open. So the picture you took his dark too dark to use. Just drop your shutter speed from 1/250 of a second to 1/125 of a second this will let in more light.

Stick to the Elph.  But you will pay more for that cuteness and size.  This camera strikes a balance between convenience, picture quality, size and features that is unmatched in this price range.Like all digital cameras it won't make gorgeous pictures with bad lighting.  Take that as a fact of life.  Unless you carry 10 1k lights around with you - you're going to get some flat, fuzzy and perhaps slightly unfocused pictures in low light settings.  If you want great night shots go for the Prosumer type Canons and buy a tripod so you can use a wide aperture and long shutter speed.In the point and shoot realm you will have to just take a bunch of pictures and know that you will need a good program to really make them shine.  I recommend Photoshop Elements.  You won't find a better consumer level program.This camera takes normal AA batteries so it is a bit heavier than those that recharge the tiny battery in the camera.  With my Energizer rechargeables I never once ran out of charge in a day.  That is with taking hundreds of pictures and turning the camera on and off.  That is very good power management!This camera has a flip out screen for a viewfinder.  It is not the biggest screen you will find on a camera and that is one of the negatives -- but you couldn't have a flip out with a 2 or 2.5 inch screen.  Don't underestimate the usefullness of that flipout!  I can't tell you how many times I was able to get a shot because I was able to orient that every which way.  It is more than just flipping it out -- you can rotate it back and forth too.  And when you flip it around you can put it back in the camera just like all the others with the screen on the back -- plus the image flips to compensate!Image Quality - this is where this camera truly shines.  Colors are vibrant.  Details are crisp.  As long as you have enough light.  Under cloudy conditions or night time then you won't get as good of shots but most can be corrected after the fact if you know how.I have a Sony camera which cost me over $1000 and this camera beats it for quality of photos.  I was also watching a guy in front of me at a concert taking pics with his brand new sleek flat Sony and every picture was blurry.  Mine weren't exactly pro quality but they were better.  Again -- low light is tough for a little point and shoot.You can fit this camera in your pocket if you have big pockets that are loose.  Tight jeans -- forget it.  But you won't scratch this screen like I've heard Elph owners complain about.  I suggest going to a store and trying to put it in your pocket.Bottom line - If you want a great quality camera and don't mind it not being the latest and thinnest camera out there you can't go wrong with this.  To get the same image quality you would have to buy other cameras for several hundred more.

It is one of those rare cameras that can serve as an excellent and simple point-and-shoot (for my wife) or can be used in such a way so as to satisfy people wanting more control over their photography (for me!). I have owned and used several digital cameras (mostly Nikon, Olympus, and Kodak) and I am continually awed by the amount of options that this camera allows you to mess with to get your perfect picture.A few comments on some of the many benefits of the A95:- Picture quality. This camera has great picture quality. What more can I say? I suppose there is some of that famed Canon \"purple-fringing\" but it is never really an issue for me and the kinds of pictures I generally take.- Vari-angle LCD. I was a little skeptical of the swivel \"Vari-angle\" LCD probably because I thought it would be flimsy or just be a hassle, but now I don't think I could ever own another camera that doesn't have it. It gives you so many options! You can just flip the LCD around to be used just like any other digital camera, or you can maneuver it to take perfectly-aimed photos from above your head, or holding it to your side, or to take a picture of yourself, or even to look around a corner ;). Even if you only use it to turn the LCD inward to protect the screen when you store the camera, this feature is worth the money.- Uses AA batteries. You can buy rechargable AAs and a charger, but you also have the freedom to not have to use expensive propritary batteries. Our batteries went dead while sight-seeing on vacation, so we just bought a pack of AAs at the first store we saw. It's hard to think of any store that doesn't sell AA batteries.- 5 MP. This camera is such a great value for a 5 megapixel camera. When I was shopping for a new camera, I figured I'd have to settle for 3 or 4 MPs for the price range I was looking for. My 8 x 10s look amazing!- Compact Flash Cards. This still seems to be one of the cheapest formats of flash storage media and it also seems to be the sturdiest. SD is smaller, but generally more expensive and flimsier. MS is proprietary to Sony so nobody else uses them. I'm able to use CF cards for many things other than just my camera so they are an even bigger value to me.- Fast startup and picture taking.- Well-written and easy-to-understand manual.Some relatively minor gripes:- It is rather large and heavy for a point-and-shoot camera. The weight doesn't bother me at all and I'm willing to sacrifice smaller size for more functions/control.- CF cover is flimsy and kind of tricky to close. You get the hang of it, but I still worry I'll accidentally break it one of these days. The camera won't operate if the CF door is open (although it seems you could easily \"trick\" the camera into thinking the door is closed). While I worry about this, I've yet to hear of anyone actually breaking it.- Battery cover is also a little awkward to close, but it's not flimsy where I think it'll break or anything.In short, this is a great all-around camera that offers you a lot of control over your pictures.

Wimberley", "helpful": [15, 15], "reviewText": "I recently replaced my Canon S400 4MP Elph with the Powershot A95.Right away, the main differences are:Larger size, partly due to the use of 4 AA batteries.  the compartment where the batteries are stored make the camera have an excellent grip which makes the camera friendly for larger hands then the Elph series does.  (I'm a woman in my 20's, and I have small hands so this doesn't really affect me)The batteries, being AA's, not a rechargable Lithium Ion like the Elph, can be easily be bought at any store that sells AA's cheap if you run out while you're on vacation (which will happen often, as digital suck the life out of normal AA batteries)Saying that, I STRONGLY encourage you to purchase rechargable Ni-MH batteries.  I bought the Sony Super Quick BCG34HC charger, which also comes with 4 2300 Ni-MH batteries.  The batteries lasted about a week and a half of heavy picture taking with the the flash on and off, along with the display on.  For and extra twenty bucks on Amazon, it's worth it.The LCD is slightly larger.In addition, the LCD also flips out and around!  You can easily frame and take pictures of you and a friend without having to use the self timer.The manual features are far supieror to the Elph series.  The A95 Powershot allows manual focusing!  And aperature settings!  This is a far improvement and gives you a little more creative control over images.  The camera still has a complete auto setting should you just want to use it as a simple point and shoot.The lenses on the Powershot A95 are interchangable.  You can buy telephoto lenses for it (though you must also purchase an adapter for any interchangable lenses for this camera)  I think the idea is cool, but the lens and the adapter are NOT cheap.  If you bought the camera and the lenses and the adapter, you could spend an extra fifty or hundred dollars and then just get the digital rebel which would allow total creative control with fully manual settings.  Again, a fun idea, but maybe try to find the lenses used at a cheaper price.The camera turns on quickly like the Elph, and has the same small shutter lag.  It's not bad, but in low light it takes extra time to focus.The only qualm I really have with this camera is the LCD screen is WAY too bright.  Images look washed out and have innaccurate colors on the LCD screen then when you get them on the computer and print them out.  And the worst part about it is, you can't fix it.  There is NO way to adjust the brightness level of the LCD screen.  On the S400 Elph, you could adjust the brightness level of the LCD screen, on the A95 you cannot.  I like seeing my images how they will look when I am changing controls so I gett a correct picture the first time (the whole point of a digital camera!)  I think this is an oversight on Canons part and the brightness option should be included on future models.Basically, what it comes down to is, if you want a camera just for keeping in your purse and using it at parties and simple settings and the like, I would always reccomend the Canon Digital Elph Series.  They're small and have incredible image quality.However, if you want more createive control and the ability to use some manual controls, by all means buy this camera.  It can be easily used as a point and shoot, but it really is so much more.All in all, I'm very happy with the camera and all of the scene modes and extra controls.

(But of course, if you want to know the A95's functions inside and out, there's no substitute for reading the well-written manual.)- Lots of shooting options. There are some 14 different shooting modes available to cover just about every conceivable situation. Personally I use only two or three, but it's nice knowing they're there.- A great lens. Canon has long been known for quality lenses, and the one in the A95 is no exception. It features 3x optical zoom and a maximum aperture of f/2.8--shoot near and far, and in a wide range of lighting conditions. (Quick tip: to shoot indoors or in low light without using the flash or a tripod, change the ISO setting.)- Flexible (but somewhat slow) autofocus. The autofocus system automatically selects between nine points, making it easy to capture off-center subjects with ease. Unfortunately, it can be tricky getting subjects in motion, especially in low-light situations. This takes practice and a bit of trial-and-error to overcome. Hopefully Canon will address this shortcoming in the future.- \"Vari-Angle\" LCD. This is the feature that won me over. It can be manipulated very much like many camcorder LCDs, flipped out from the camera body and turned to face a wide range of angles. With the screen turned to face the same direction as the lens, you can even use the A95 as a mirror! And when the camera is not in use, the screen can be folded into the camera body, protecting it from damage. The screen measures 1.8\" diagonally and is clear and crisp, even in harsh sunlight.- Size and weight. The A95 is a lot of camera in a little package--at least compared to a full-featured digital SLR. It's compact, but not pocket-sized (unless you have rather large pockets). If you don't already have a gear bag or a purse, I recommend getting a case with a shoulder strap if you plan on carrying it around a lot. Also, the A95's got a decent amount of heft to it. Personally I don't mind the weight; coming from the professional world, I like the feeling of something solid in my hand.- Batteries and battery life. One reason the camera weighs a bit is because it uses four AA batteries. Opinions vary on this, but I consider this a positive. If my batteries die, it's easy to drop in a new set and get going again. The A95 will use either conventional alkaline batteries or NiMH rechargeables; I recommend picking up a set or two of the latter. They're available cheap from a wide variety of places (something I can't say about the proprietary rechargeables found in most other digital cameras, other Canon models included).My only complaint in this department is that there's no visible battery life indicator on the LCD; you're only told when a battery set is on its last legs. I wouldn't worry too much about this. You can get hundreds of shots out of a single set of alkaline AAs and can get even more out of a set of rechargeables, and you can extend battery life further by limiting your use of the flash and LCD. But keep a spare set handy, just in case.- Uses CompactFlash memory. The A95 uses CompactFlash Type I, which is compatible with Canon and Nikon's digital SLRs. If you already have a digital SLR, you'll be able to share memory cards (as long as they're Type I, not the thicker Type II). If you're a pro looking for a camera for casual use, this is something to think about.You'll definitely want to pick up a high-capacity card; you'll only get about 10 pictures, if that, out of the included 32 MB card. I recommend at least a 512 MB card--the bigger the better. I also recommend getting a USB CompactFlash card reader for your computer. Connecting the camera to your computer directly drains battery life (unless you have an AC adapter, not included with the camera). Use that battery life to shoot more pictures!- Attention to detail. Canon's A series may be their \"value\" line, but there's nothing cheap about the feel of this camera. Every button gives solid tactile feedback. The shutter has a well-defined distinction between half-down (to focus) and full-down (to shoot). And thanks to the built-in orientation sensor, photos shot vertically are oriented properly in playback mode. Little touches like these make all the difference.ConclusionThere are cameras that are smaller, lighter, better-looking, less expensive, and with more features. If you want smaller, lighter, or better-looking, try the Canon S or SD series. If you want something less expensive, try the other A series models like the A510. If you want more features, move on up to an SLR like the Digital Rebel. But it's hard to find a camera that can balance all of these considerations as well as the A95. It's a rare gem of a camera that has something for everyone--ease of use for a beginner, more features and control for an amateur or professional. And given the rich feature set and Canon's renowned picture quality, it's an incredible value.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Phenomenal!", "unixReviewTime": 1122422400, "reviewTime": "07 27, 2005"}

Here something different I can add....I bought and return 4 different digital cameras before I got the powershot A95. The Reason I went through so many digital cameras was because I own a SLR Canon EOS Rebel (I paid $500 for it 8 yrs ago) I absolutely Love my Rebel all my picture come out beautifully clear and I'm Never disappointed but it's not digital. I was so stuck on my rebel that when I used the Kodak, Minolta, Nikon & HP digital cameras (in same price range as canon) they just didn't measure up to my Rebels different setting & photo quality and that is why I would return them!!!Finally I realized I need to try a canon digital and pick the powershot A95 (because of it's small size). I LOVE this camera you won't see me returning it!!!  What I like the most about this digital over the others I've owned is that it has all the setting my rebel has, Plus 8 more setting my rebel doesn't.****For those who have used a Rebel before, if you haven't it's not as hard to use as it sounds below****With my Rebel to get a better blur free photo of my kids moving, I usually had to set the aperture myself, then adjust the ISO then set the filtration (which you can also do on powershot A95) But with the A95 you just set your dial to SCN then pick \"kids & pet\" & it does all the work for you, the picture will come out Blur free every time & you won't have to mess with any apertures, ISO or anything. It also has \"indoor\" setting, if you have a Bright lamp on (like 4-- 100watt bulb fan light) on in the house you can turn the Flash OFF (trust me turn it off and you won't have to worry about red eye either) and the indoor setting will make your picture come out like you used a flash, it's better then Auto setting!!!I agree with the others reviews that the powershot A95 does get red eye sometime (just like you will with any digital with a Built in flash). Here is a tip to keep in mind, the ONLY way to guarantee zero red eye in every picture is you'll need to buy a Digital with an -------Attachable flash------- (means you can take the flash off the camera) attachable flashes have more power, more light and better reflection against red eye but those type of digital cost about $1,400+ !!! For under $300 for powershot A95 you won't be disappointed.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "If you own a Rebel you love the A95", "unixReviewTime": 1110758400, "reviewTime": "03 14, 2005"}

The most noticeable is the jump to 5 megapixels at $100 lower MSRP than the A80 when it came out!  Then there is the larger rotating LCD that is now useable in low light, scene modes for those who don't like to tinker with the settings, and the print/share button to make things easier.  For those who don't know, scene modes are easy-to-access presets of a combination of manual adjustments, optimized for shooting in different situations such as when you are indoors, at the beach, taking shots of kids, shooting at night, or shooting fireworks, etc.  There is also the addition of the Flexi-Zone feature, which lets you choose one of the 9 autofocus spots, so you can focus on non-centered objects!  This is usually a feature only found on much higher priced cameras.  The camera features full manual controls over shutter speed and aperture, manual focus, saturation, exposure compensation, custom white balance, ISO, metering, and a histogram in playback mode.  I know most people think they won't ever use some of these, but when you have an important shot that just isn't coming out, you'll be really glad you have it (or wish you did).  For those who don't know, control over shutter speed means you can use a fast shutter speed to capture fast action or you can use a slow shutter to avoid using a flash or for taking shots of night scenery like a city-scape.The areas where the Canon A75, A85, and A95 really excel at are:Being fairly small(small price tag too!) for a camera with this many features and having picture quality this good.Creative shooting:  this is a great camera for those who want to do creative shooting but can't afford to plop down $600+ for a Canon G6 or more for a Digital SLR.  It's got all of the most important controls, and with your memory card, you can do all the creative shooting and experimenting you want virtually free compared to using film.  It's even expandable with telephoto, wide angle, or close up conversion lenses and there's also the waterproof casing.  One other plus is the flip-out rotating LCD screen, which is VERY useful when your camera is on a tripod, is low to the ground, or when the camera is pointed up but below shoulder height, because you can simply flip the LCD screen to the proper viewing position instead of getting down behind the camera.  You can also use it to shoot over peoples' heads and use it to get a preview when you are doing self portraits.All Canon cameras also come with an excellent software package that lets you stitch panoramic photos, retouch photos or rescue those that came out wrong, add special effect, and view thumbnails of pictures so you don't have to open them up to see what the picture looks like (good for those who are using an older version of windows, I know there are still a lot of you out there).  The best part is that it's free!  It does more than Kodak's software(which is pretty decent), you have to pay $20 to get the better version of Olympus's software, and Sony's editing software is pretty much non-existent.  Those who already have Photoshop won't be excited.For those of you who are concerned that the camera doesn't come with rechargeable batteries, don't worry, it's really not a big deal.  Good rechargeable AA's, type NiMH are super cheap at around $10-$15 for 4, compared to $50 for Lithium Ion battery packs, and at that price, everyone can afford a spare set, which is really important to have.  I've seen people who bought much crappier cameras at the same price, just because they came with rechargeable batteries - not a smart choice in my opinion.Yes, there is the problem with purple fringing, but it's not a very common problem and most people either don't know what it is or don't even know think it's much of a problem when they see it.  Some people think it looks cool.  With full control over aperture, you have the ability to get rid of it or at least reduce it.  Compared to the problems that other manufacturers have with their cameras, I'd take a bit of purple fringing over noise, soft/fuzzy images, and over-sharpening any day!If you are looking to spend much less but want to get pretty much the same camera at 4 megapixels, check out the Canon Powershot A85 or the 3 megapixel A75.  you lose the rotating LCD though.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent camera, great value", "unixReviewTime": 1095292800, "reviewTime": "09 16, 2004"}

My basic requirements were that it be an ultra-zoom and that it have image stabilization (ultra-zoom isn't much good without it unless you always use a tripod. If you do, you can save about [...] by foregoing IS). I quickly learned that the current sweet-spot of the market for this class of camera is 5 M pixels, so I further narrowed my search to that. The choices were: Panasonic Lumix DMC F20 and F5; Konica Minolta DImage Z5; Sony CyberShot DSC H1; and Canon Poweshot S2 IS. All cameras in this class use an electronic viewfinder (EVF), which I'm not as fond of as optical.I quickly dismissed the Konica because it takes very mediocre pictures. The images just can't compare to anything else in this class in crispness or low noise.The big hurdle for cameras in this class to get over is chromatic aberration. For a lens to be able to bend light to a proper focus across the color spectrum at a zoom of 1x to 12x is a terrific challenge. At the long zooms, lenses tend to show a color \"fringe\" around edges if they aren't exceptionally well made. Of the remaining cameras, Canon was the worst of the lot on this. I have an SD-200, which is an ultra-compact with 3x zoom, and it has a bit of a problem this way. So I was not surprised that the long zoom from them would also have this problem. The Sony is not too bad at this, but chromatic aberration is clearly present at higher zooms. The Panasonic's Leica lens is the stand-out in this regard.As to LCD, the Sony has the largest and brightest of the displays. The Panasonic is second-largest (2-inch screen) and adequately bright. The Canon is the smallest, at 1.5 inches, but has the virtue of folding out and twisting around to allow you to take pictures from odd angles, using it as the viewfinder. Also, it folds into place for storage with its back to the outside word, so its protected against bumps. The Canon is the least visible of the LCDs in bright light, and the size is pretty small for reading menus. For me, each of the LCDs was good enough, and none was ideal.All cameras of this class image-process the data before you ever see a picture. By default, Sony processes their images way too much. They smooth the noise, and then put back the appearance of sharpness by (what I presume to be) unsharp masking. You can see the Gibbs effect on sharp transitions (the image looks like water is lapping against the sharp edge). I find this very irritating. But the images show absolutely no noise, and at first blush look like they are very sharp. I think Sony does this to impress the unwary with \"image quality\" that isn't really there. Canon chooses a middle path on processing by default, and Panasonic allows their wonderful lens' resolution to come through the images, at the expense of higher noise than the other cameras show. All cameras allow you to adjust the processing settings, so this is just their choice for out-of-the-box. I strongly prefer the Panasonic default to the others. I can always smooth the images in PhotoShop if I like, but I can't retrieve the native resolution once its been smoothed away.Manual focus is important to me. The Sony has a rather clunky way of getting at manual focus (keep pushing a button near the shutter button until the viewfinder shows a distance bar, then you can use the rocker switch on the back to focus.) Canon is better. There is a button by the lens to switch to manual focus, and then use the back rocker switch to focus. The FZ5 doesn't support manual focus, so this was when I dropped it from contention. The FZ20 has a switch at the side of the lens that puts it in manual mode. Flick the switch all the way down if you like (it bounces back up to the manual position), and it will auto-focus to get you started. Then, you use a ring around the lens to manually focus, just like a film 35 mm camera. Panasonic won that part of the UI hands down.I don't much care about using the camera for movies. If you do, Canon is the clear winner. It takes full-size M-JPEG video (640x480, 30 fps). You can zoom while you shoot the video (unique to this camera AFAIK). The Sony takes 640x480 30 fps MPEG-1, which has the advantage of being smaller on the camera, but the disadvantage of falling apart if you edit the video after acquiring it. The Panasonic is awful in this regard -- 320x240 30 fps M-JPEG video. But I use a camcorder for video, not a still camera, so I took no points off for this. YMMVAt this point, I had pretty much zeroed in on the Canon vs the FZ20. Because my other camera is a Canon, using the same Digic-II processor that I love, I was favorably disposed to the Canon. The user interface is excellent on Canon cameras, and the color and focus are excellent. I knew that it would take good pictures with little fuss.The FZ20 also has excellent controls -- with one big exception. To change aperture or shutter speed in Program (fully automatic) mode, you need to press the shutter button half-way down, then press the Exposure button on the back of the camera, and then you can adjust using the rocker switch. The maneuver is every bit as awkward as it sounds. However, I seldom use the Program mode -- I normally use aperture priority, and the adjustment interface is perfectly fine for anything other than the Program mode.The Canon has ISO ratings of 50, 100, 200, and 400. The Panasonic's are 80, 100, 200, and 400. What I dislike about the Panasonic on this is that a natural way to use the ISO is as a \"poor man's\" neutral density filter. To do the moral equivalent of adding a 0.3 ND filter, just cut the ISO rating in half. Canon has the right steps for doing that across its range. Also, the Canon has a max. shutter speed of 1/3200, while the Panasonic tops out at 1/2000.One thing that matters to me is using filters. I use a circular polarized filter to cut down on glare, or a graduated neutral density filter for landscapes with a bright sky and dark foreground. The Panasonic comes with the lens adapter to take filters (72mm, which are a bit pricey). The Canon takes 55 mm filters -- a bit cheaper -- but does not come with the adapter. It is apparently not easy to get the adapter, especially if you order the camera itself on-line to save money. Even from a camera store, getting the adapter is apparently \"iffy.\"Ultimately, I just couldn't get away from the quality of the Leica lens. In addition to virtually no chromatic aberration, the uniformity of focus and illumination of the lens across the field I wanted to get a new camera for our upcoming trip to Greece. My basic requirements were that it be an ultrazoom and that it have image stabilization (ultrazoom isn't much good without it unless you always use a tripod. If you do, you can save about $150 by foregoing IS). I quickly learned that the current sweet-spot of the market for this class of camera is 5 MPixels, so I further narrowed my search to that. The choices were: Panasonic Lumix DMC F20 and F5; Konica Minolta DImage Z5; Sony CyberShot DSC H1; and Canon Poweshot S2 IS. All cameras in this class use an electronic viewfinder (EVF), which I'm not as fond of as optical.A few final points on the Panasonic FZ5 vs the FZ20. The FZ5 is about $100 less expensive than the FZ20. However, in addition to no manual focus, the FZ5 does not use ED glass in its Leica lens -- a big difference (adds to chromatic aberration). It also does not have a constant f/2.8 max aperture across the whole zoom -- it creeps up to f/3.3 at the longer lens settings. The constant f is unique to the FZ20 in this class of camera AFAIK, and is a very nice touch. The FZ5 does not have a hot shoe for external flash, which is a big disadvantage. For other differences, go to the [...]I have purchased the FZ20 and begun the learning curve for getting the max out of the camera. This is a camera for enthusiasts more than for causal photographers. I expet it will take me a few months of experimentation in different contexts to really fully appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of this camera.

The zoom is great and basically, the camera could be considered \"the poor man's answer to a digital SLR\".  Except it isn't an SLR.  The lens, made of very high quality by Lecia, is fixed mount.  You can't remove it, but it has an incredible zoom of up to about 430mm.  This makes it much more than a point and shoot, and gives you the flexibility of higher priced SLRs.Overall, this camera has numerous features!!! Easy to use controls, great battery life.  The camera is much larger than a point and shoot so know that going in.  The battery is a Panasonic unit, not AA or AAA, so it will cost a bit to replace.  It comes with the camera, along with an easy to use, compact charger.Photo quality - great!  For best results (lower noise) I set the ISO to 80 when possible.  You can shoot at F2.8 throughout the zoom range (even Panasonic's new 8MP Lumix doesn't offer that, dropping to 3.7 toward the longer range).You can shoot fully programmed or go manual if you are a camera buff.  You can use all the modes in between - shutter preferred, apeture preferred, etc.About all you give up versus a $1500-$2000 SLR is the ability to change lenses and a slightly lower shutter (some Canon SLRs fire at 1/8000 second).  This camera also has a smaller CCD sensor than some of the Canons, but again - the Panasonic is less than $500.  The CCD is what makes the photo quality on any digital cam, in the end.  ISO can be set to auto, or from 80-400.Stabilizer - helps keep shots sharp throughout a long focal length.  You have two options for stablizing photos.  One is throughtout the focus and one is at the time of the photo.  I set mine for just the time of the photo and feel that provides better results for sports photos (soceer, lacrosse).Bracketing - lets you bracket exposures, which works great when you are shooting on the beach, for example.  You have sun off the water, or maybe behind your subject, so you can bracket the exposures automatically and shoot 3 shots with one click, so you get an over/normal/under exposure and one should be a great shot!  This also helps with pictures of kids, as you essentially get a few different facial expressions (the bracket shots are after all in succession, not the same exact instant).You can also set the camera to fire off multiple shots on one click of the shutter (bursts) and get 10-20 shots in rapid fire, capturing that one or two \"perfect\" photos.  In addition there is a flip animation feature, which lets you create nice \"flip page\" features of your kids, pets, etc.You have a decent flip up flash as well as a hot shoe for an external flash.The camera has a built in video cam - just keep in mind that it locks the lens on whatever focal length you are at when you go to video mode, so this is not really for anything other than basic video.The camera also has full audio, so you can record sound and/or add narration to your photos to refer to later.Other features include numerous metering options, an auto focus \"assist lamp\" for low light, and histogram options.  It even has several settings like \"sports/snow/fireworks\" and so on, so you can choose one of those for different photo scenarios.  i've tried them all and they don't hurt the photos, although I'm not sure they enhance any given photo scenario.  But I tend to chose my own shutter and other settings, shooting manually much of the time.  if you prefer to shoot in auto mode, I doubt you'll be unhappy.This camera is a must own for a family.  It gives you great shots of the kids.The included software works fine, so this camera easily connects and works on your PC.The two downsides:The lens cap is not clip on, so you might lose it.  I use the included lens hood almost all the time so I don't worry too much about the cap.  The other downside - you need a good memory card to use any 5 megapixel camera - Panasonic includes only a 16mb.  You want at least 256mb, preferably 512mb and up.  if you are going to shoot at lot of bursts, get a high speed, quality card.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A Digital SLR trapped in a non-SLR Body - Great Product", "unixReviewTime": 1128729600, "reviewTime": "10 8, 2005"}

After thousands of fabulous pictures in virtually all conditions, I can confidently say that this is the camera that permanently switched me to digital.  Unlike previous generations of prosumer cameras, this was the one to offer practical advanced features that I don't ever want to be without.  This camera allows you to shoot in a true HDTV mode, or 1920x1080.  That comfortable, widescreen frame allowed me to take most of my pictures in that format, and make professional-looking pictures for presentation in any media - print, LCD projector, plasma TV, or LCD monitor.  More important, this camera gives you the features of an SLR in a single-lens design.  The F-Stop settings range from 2.8 to 8.0, and shutter speed ranges from 8 seconds to 1/2000th of a second.  This allows for photographing still subjects in low light conditions (without a flash), or action shots in daylight or sporting events.  The big Leica lens gives this camera the performance of many film rangefinder cameras, as well as SLR zoom lenses (30mm - 432mm optical zoom is quite adequate for most users).  If there was a camera that made the case that SLR's are only for journalists, red carpet, and wedding photographers, this is it.

The digital zoom takes acceptable quality images even at the maximum 48x, if you can hold it steady enough. The image stabilizer is rather challenged at that magnification. Use one of those slick little car-window mounted tripods for long shots when you're on the road.It feels good, and overall worksmanship seems solid. Nothing on it feels flimsy. It is bit heavy for packing along on a hike, but it replaces an even heavier Canon EOS with two lenses and extra film, so it's a net gain. And my Canon doesn't even come close to 48x zoom.I printed some photos on good-quality photo paper with a Canon Pixma ip4200, and you cannot tell that they are not film photos.The autofocus works well under challenging conditions, though it struggles a bit in low-light and low-contrast situations. The manual focus is nice to have, but it's not as easy to see when you're in focus on the LCD screen as it is on a film camera.The rechargeable battery pack lasts a long time- I can go for a couple of weeks on the same charge if I don't do a lot of flash pictures. (note that the flash intensity is adjustable!) It has a hot shoe for an external flash.I put a one-gigabyte high-speed SD card in it, so I can go on a picture-taking frenzy and not worry. (Why do they even bother with those dumb little 16mb cards?)The controls are well-designed and well-laid out, unlike a lot of digital cameras, which seem to delight in making common tasks unnecessarily complex.Color balance, contrast, and details are excellent. A plus for me is it supports TIFF as well as JPG. (And even RAW, for whatever good that does, since every vendor has a different idea of what RAW should be.)It takes movies with sound, and comes with audio cables for copying your little movies to a computer.The camera comes with a lens hood, and you can put filters on it, though I haven't found anyone who sells filters yet. A skylight filter should be inexpensive, and you can leave it on all the time to protect the lens.The bundled software is pretty good, and easy to use.

Menus are clear and easy to use, and switching between functions is fool proof.The optics on this camera are outstanding.  If you are buying a digital camera, the digital zoom is virtually worthless as a consideration for purchase.  The optical zoom (in this case 12x) is the critical zoom function.

On 3 different systems, and eacheventually had several lenses, typically a 24mm, a 28-80, and an 80-250.The 80-250 at f3.5 was HUGE. More recently I have gone thru 3 digitalcameras, an HP215, a Pentax EI200, and a Canon A70. The Canon had thewidest zoom range at 3x and I also used a 2.4x Canon teleconverter with it.So it was a handful as well.I wanted to simplify my life, and yet preserve the quality of the photos Iam accustomed to taking. In other words as much zoom range, built in manualfunctions, external flash capability, etc, but NOT a 5-10 lbs bag ofaccessories everywhere I go. Not really of utmost importance was themegapixel resolution, I have taken prize winning and nationwide calendarphotos with a 2 megapixel camera. Many schools of thought here, add thisone; a hi res monitor will display 1280x1024 pixels with sometimes painfulclarity and sharpness. Yet that is barely 1.5 megapixel, the source and thequality (dynamic range, edge sharpness, focus) of the original have as muchimpact as the number of dots. This became important when I chose the FZ20,as the other camera in consideration was the Nikon 8800 (The Minolta Z5photo quality made it a non starter). It had 8 vs 5 meg resolution, but notthat wonderful Leica f2.8 lens, and that's f2.8 at 430mm! Compare that tothe Nikon's f5.2 at only 350mm. In photography the lens is everything. Indigital photography, that is closely followed by the CCD sensor size (theNikon is ahead here, however both camera test results show objectionablenoise at ISO200 and higher, so shoot at 80 or 100 ISO when possible). So adigital SLR was too big and required a bag of lenses, the one lens thatcame with the Nikon was only so-so, and the Panasonic got the nod ofapproval.So how does it fare after 4 weeks and about 1500 photos? Very well indeed.The Lens is outstanding, the image stabilization works superbly, the 4 fpsmotor drive is great, and the pictures are tack sharp and stunning inquality.

These comments are based on my own experience, balanced by what I have read on other digital camera forums.Noise-- easily noticeable on an 8 by 10, at ISO 100.  Navy blue pants had red specks.  This is a function of the small sensor, which allows the long lens at a reasonable size.  I have read that the FZ15 (4 mp)  has less noise, almost all the same features.  The lesson learned is that sensor size makes a big difference, you do not want higher megapixels without increasing the sensor size.Viewfinder \"freeze\"-- When using 3-zone focus, when you are test focussing by halfway pressing shutter, frame freezes.  Disrupting to try to shoot picure when this occurs.  Avoidable with other focussing modes.Downloading pictures-- When using windows camera wizard, pictures do not appear and do not download in the order you took them, unlike my Canon S30.  You have to pick through the old and new picture to download.Filter use-- Camera has unorthodox filter system, comes with lens hood which will accept 72 mm filters, but at some distance from the lens, increasing storage bulk.  People are buying various aftermarket filter adapters, but these increase the bulk of the camera when the camera is off.  (Camera lens retracts during shutoff ).  I am going to try a Nextphoto.net filter adapter which snaps into the retracting lens, to get both filter capability AND the compact size during storage.Instruction manual-- Could be a bit more educational/explanatory, not too clear in many spots.White balance-- Unlike a CanonS30 which I still use, I find the colors sometimes seem dull and bluish-- some think faces look pink, especially with flash.  The solution is to adjust the white balance two clicks toward red.

Colors look faded and washed out like they came out of an antique album.  Also, pictures are cast in the hue of the predominant item such that even skin looks purple if the subject is wearing a purple shirt.  This is something that one cannot fix well with software.

I have had 4 other digital cameras over the past 5 years, 3 of them Olympus and 1 HP Photosmart all in the $200-$250 range. Out of all of them my favorite was the Olympus D-565 Zoom. I was having problems with slow shutter speeds on all of them and my shots were very blurry. The only way I could get them to be less fuzzy was by using the flash which wasn't appropriate for all the shots I was taking. I didn't like using a tripod either to get steadier clearer shots so I decided it was time to look for a much better camera.I searched the web for reviews on cameras with quicker shutter speeds, which were not too expensive. I really wanted a digital DSLR camera but when I saw the prices I realized I couldn't afford them. I found a few models that were in the DSLR style. I was crossed between the Canon PowerShot S2 IS, this Panasonic model FZ20 and the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-H1 Digital CameraDSC-H1. It was a very difficult choice but I decided on the Panasonic DMC-FZ20 because it seemed to have a cult following. Not to mention I have had problems before with Sony products in the past so I was wary of another Sony product.Today my camera arrived and when I took it out of the box I instantly fell in love! It is a very sturdy, well made camera. I really like the way it looks because it has the look and feel of a professional 35 mm camera professional photographers use. It looks bigger than the product pictures show, however it is not too heavy. By the looks and feel you can see it is not a cheaply made camera and is very sturdy. It feels really good in my hands.I quickly charged the battery and fired it up. I couldn't wait to start taking pictures. I quickly skimmed the manual, but have to admit I didn't read it in depth {I will do that later}. When I took my 1st shot which was indoors in bad lighting I was very surprised! It was like night and day compared to my other point and shoot digital Olympus cameras I have been using. The image stabilizer really works well and is a Godsend! I didn't have to use my flash and the pictures came out without no blur. Way to go Panasonic!Next, I took it outdoors and it is a very overcast cloudy day. I was surprised to see that it also did a very good job. When I start reading the manual and play around with all the features I know this camera will take very good top notch pictures.The features this camera has is too numerous for me to list. I couldn't believe how many bells and whistles this camera has. I was so used to my bare bones point and shoot digital cameras that didn't have too many features that I was speechless when I saw how much things I can use to take optimal photos.

Although this camera takes very good outdoor pictures, it wasn't so good indoors and even outdoors would sometimes have trouble focussing if you zoomed in too close.  For the purposes I wanted to use it - photographing fine lace and dolls for my e-books - it was next to useless.So after many months of dreaming, thinking and comparing review after review I began to get closer this week.  I looked at the Fuji S7000 and S20 Pro, Sony DSC-828, Nikon Coolpix 8800, Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ5, and a number of other similar superzoom cameras.  Every time I compared any of them to the Panasonic Lumix DMC FZ20 the only camera which came anywhere near to it was the FZ5.  So today it ended up being a battle between the FZ5 and FZ20 and when I saw the FZ20K beside the FZ5 in Jessops today the battle was over.  I would have liked the silver but Jessops only had the black model; nevertheless the FZ20 it was.So far I have had the battery charged for about half an hour - way to go Panasonic, it only takes 2 hours to charge the battery for this large camera - and basically the camera is light years ahead of my Fuji Finepix 2600 camera (which takes perfectly good indoor pictures but often requires some adjustments in lighting arrangements) and the aforementioned Minolta Dimage Z2.  The lense is frankly amazing to see, and the camera is packed in the box with a lense cover protecting it.  The camera and lens hood and lens hood adaptor are carefully wrapped in a soft protective plastic wrap within the box, to minimise the chances of any damage.The menus are easy to navigate with very little instruction and the manual is not one of those which provides minimal information and then expects you to print out hundreds of pages from a PDF file.  It contains all the information you would need to operate the camera, all the safety information and everything into a 118 page booklet which is clearly laid out and easy to follow.  There is a lot of information to digest, but then this camera is really a DSLR with some point and shoot functions.  It compared favourably in appearance with the Canon EOS 300D which one of the other people in the shop had with him.  It certainly is no toy and will provide both point and shoot enthusiasts and manual control enthusiasts with an excellent range of facilities.The camera of course has full manual capabilities as well as a wide range of modes and different settings for the image sizes as you would expect.  The flash is operated by a button on the back - an advantage in some museums where you are allowed to take photographs provided you disable the flash.  The zoom is wonderful and it's exciting to watch the camera autofocus stabiliser working and focussing beautifully on the area you want it to photograph.I took photographs of some fine tatted lace this evening - if you don't know what tatting is look at my web site, [...] - and you could see every stitch.  This is something that my Fuji Finepix 2600 2 megapixel camera could accomplish with care, good lighting and macro photography on a tripod; the Panasonic does it without any zoom at all and just holding the camera a few inches from the lace - this in a hallway which is not particularly well lit in the evenings.Way to go Panasonic, this is a wonder camera which will provide many years of photographic enjoyment!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Superlative digital camera", "unixReviewTime": 1126137600, "reviewTime": "09 8, 2005"}

The first good camera I bought was a Minolta Maxxum 7000 back in the mid 80's. This was a good camera and I took many pictures over the years. The first digital I bought was the 3MP Olympus C3000 in 2001. In mid 2004, the camera bit the dust (unfixable). Luckily, I had an extended warranty and the retailer allowed me to choose another camera which cost the same as the Olympus. The only one they had in stock which suited me at the time was Kodak's DX7590. I kept the camera for a couple of months and even though it took good pictures, something just wasn't right. The detail was lacking, shots were not consistent and white balance was off at times. Even though it was a little faster than the Oly, still something was missing. Since it was a replacement, and I was ready to upgrade anyhow, selling it outright would not be a loss to me.I wanted a good camera in the $500 range, at least 5MP and a powerful zoom. I researched and researched, and everything seem to lead me back to the Panasonic FZ20 time and time again. I was nervous about complaints on some noise, dim LCD and battery life.  I ordered the FZ20 and I must say I made a good decision. Maybe I've had bad apples in the past and didn't know a good digital when I saw one, but the Panasonic far exceeds my expectations.It is quick to focus (even in a dim lit room). The zoom is fast and awesome. The histogram is a nice feature. The noise is not detectable for 99% of the shots, and probably 100% of the shots for most users. The flash has a very good range, as well. It reminds me a lot of my Maxxum 7000 in the feel, functionality, and operation. I took and compared similar pictures with the Kodak and found that the Kodak was richer in color, but the Panasonic was clearer. However, the Panasonic has settings which increased saturation. As far as the the LCD brightness, I'm not sure where those complaints come from. It's bright enough for me. It does dim a little when you press the shutter, but that is no concern to me at that point.If you are looking for a simple, no thrills, point and shoot camera, the Panasonic may not be for you. Don't get me wrong, the panasonic produces good pictures by pointing and shooting, but you have much more control over varying situations if you need that control. I think it is more of a professional camera than the Kodak and Oly, which I previously owned.Not sure on what color to get? Silver or Black. That was a hard decision for me, but I recommend the black. It's sharp looking, and any lens accessories you buy will probably be black, too. I've heard that when silver finishes wear they show black. That was enoght to turn me against the silver.So, if you are looking for a 5MP range, long zoom, professional feel and operation type camera, which takes excellent pictures, look no further. I think the Panasonic DMC-FZ20 will make you happy.Update: After two months of use, I like this camera even more. I always display the most recent pictures as a slideshow screensaver (full screen) on our PC. Looking over the Christmas pictures, I am intrigued by the clarity, color richness, and natural look given by these photographs. I've also purchased a lens tube adapter (Raynox RT5264P) and attached a 52mm UV filter. If you want your camera to look even sharper, get the lens adapter. The lens hood which comes with the camera is nice to have gotten, but it is mainly for bright light situations, and  the thread size is like 72mm. The hood is good for wide angle, but zoom shots have a decreased angle of view, can can cause flare and ghost images.

I have taken thousands of pictures with them, so I can give you a good assessment of what you should expect. Since I've sold these, I upgraded to a Rebel XT, so I can also tell you how they compare.Interesting thing about the model is that, for various reasons, it has a very very loyal and almost cult-like following who make this camera sound like it's made by God himself. FZ20 is not \"all that\" as people here there and everywhere will tell you. It is just a very decent prosumer-grade camera.That said, I would recommend this over Canon S2IS (although comparable in image quality, feels like a toy over this one), and the Sony DSC-H1 (just not as polished enough as a serious camera). Yes, I have had a decent amount of experience using both of these other cameras.Many people will tell you that this camera can produce images so good that you won't be able tell the difference between it and one from a more expensive dSLR. This is only half-correct. Let me tell you that even with the mediocre kit-lens of the Canon Rebel XT (which you all know is the low-end model dSLR), you will be able to tell the difference when compared side-by-side. Better contrast, color balance, sharpness, just more lively and \"better-looking.\" On the other hand, if you just show the picture from an FZ20 and tell them that it's from a Canon 5D, you can probably fool most people (including me). But then again, I am very confident that I can take a picture with my Canon A620 and do the same.I seem to be too much on the negative here, so let me compensate for my 4-stars. With good lighting, this camera can produce some very impressive images, and the zoom reach is just awesome. If you haven't had experience with ultra-zooms, you will appreciate how it opens up another world of opportunities in your composition. I would go out to the street, sit on a bench, start shooting away at people without them noticing me at all... resulting in people looking very natural, not looking into the camera and smiling.Let me close by noting a very very important difference between these two cameras. The FZ20 is a \"daylight\" camera. If you need to take pictures over ISO80 (on the FZ20), you WILL DEFINITELY be able to tell the difference between the image it produces and one a Rebel XT would produce under the same ISO. ISO400 shots on this camera is, I am sorry, HORRENDOUS. That's right. HORRENDOUS. You cannot use it. This means that if you use it in auto setting in a semi-dark place (even inside of a decently lit building), you will get a bad image. If you set the ISO low and lower the speed to compensate, you will get a blurred image - if not from your handshake (please, the IS is good, but it doesn't do magic), then from your subject moving. The Rebel XT, set your ISO up to 800, it's STILL better than the FZ20's ISO 200. In fact, the XT's ISO 1600 is comparable to FZ20's ISO 200. This means great pictures even when your not outside in the daytime.Hope you found this helpful :)", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "FZ20 vs Rebel XT", "unixReviewTime": 1149292800, "reviewTime": "06 3, 2006"}

It started with the compact cameras in the 80s, the cheap japanese cameras with their tiny little slow lens. For the first time people realized that good pictures can still be taken with tiny lens instead of the big expensive 35mm instruments.Since that time the cheap japanese cameras used this to the extreme that noise was so obvious. In the digital age, compact cameras are still doing that and gets poor noise control simply because of not enough light through the lens.DSLR is much better for this purpose, except that a good huge lens is hard to manufacture, unlike smaller lenses. DSLR and the tiny little lenses used in most compact digital cameras are the two ends of consumer photography. A balance of the amount of light and the quality of lens allowable for consumers.FZ series is such a good example of this elegant balance. I've used the FZ-1, FZ-10, and now the FZ-20. They are simply the king of the jungle. With the constant F/2.8, they conquer the shortcoming of light deficiency of compact digital cameras. With the proven Leica lens design, they provide lens of beauty.The reasons I upgrade my FZ-10 to FZ-20 are as follows:1. FZ20 separates the link between metering and focusing. In FZ-10 if you want spot-metering, you also have to use spot-focusing. But in FZ-20, you can do spot-metering with any kind of metering options.2. FZ20 has the more realistic knob layout so you can exchange A/S/M modes without going to the menus, as FZ-10 was designed.3. I can sell my old FZ-10 for the price of a new FZ-20 on amazon now4. other minor reasons such as an AF assist lamp, much more powerful flash, and 1M pixels, faster focusing, cooler petal hood, etc.etc.I know that after the engineering wonders of FZ-1 and FZ-20, I can expect beauty out of FZ-20, and I did. I do have a Canon 350D and a SONY F707 too.

I have to add - Don't overlook the construction on your dSLR.  I had heavy long telephoto lenses on it and the performance of the magnesium case, metal mounts, weather proofing, battery grip all is just amazing.  I hate to imagine how a lesser plastic frame might have performed.  After traveling by rattling/vibration ridden truck for days, dugout canoes in the middle of swamps, airplanes, hiking -- I came to appreciate Canon's commitment to construction. This camera and and the entire EOS system held up superbly under extremely abusive circumstances and can understand why professional photographers prefer this brand.  And the pictures?  Oh My, the pictures are just simply the best pictures I have ever taken in my life.  Not just because of the locations but because of this terriffic equipment.  My friend who had another major brand of camera complained about a muddy ant inside his lens, imagine a muddy ant inside his other major brand lens while he was shooting -- not with my Canon equipment (the sealing held up great).  Albeit - he's a better photographer so he probably got amazing shots I didn't -- I didn't worry about the equipment.  A+++ to Canon for the camera, the lenses, the battery grip - everything.On other news, I just read that canon is releasing the 5D so I guess my info from the original review was correct.  Its definitely a bigger higher end camera and at $3,200 definitely in a different class.  I think I'll keep my 20D for telephoto work and but with its full frame sensor, I might get a 5D for wide angle photography.  Again, amazing equipment from Canon.Original Review:I'm a first time dSLR buyer  (bought the 20D from Amazon -- great service).  This was a big jump for me and I read and I read before I decided on this purchase and whether I should jump into the dSLR world.  I'd outgrown point and shoot a while back.On the 20D.  I agonized over the 10D and the 6megapix Digital Rebel until the 20D came out and I quickly decided on the 20D.  I picked the 20D because of solid magnesium case, 9point autofocus, 8.2megapix sensor and DIGIC II, and Instant On.  So even after the Rebel XT came out -- the 20D is in a different class altogether. The 20D is a professional chassis and you can use it as a pro camera -- the Rebel is for world travelers (In my opinion).My agony now is over what type of photography I want to do.  I only have the kit lens and a $79 dollar 50mm f/1.8 II ... lenses are expensive especially the good ones as I'm learning:Here is what I've learned (intended for the new people who are wondering if they want dSLR or not).  dSLR is really about the lenses and the options that you can use on the camera. You need great lenses for great pictures. This is my gradeschool version on dSLRs and lenses and I hope it helps:The setup -- Lets suppose you are standing next to your car and on your car's hood sits your girlfriend and on the hood unbeknownst to her sits a litle grasshopper.  Behind your car is a lake and in the distance there's a huge snow capped mountain.  This is the difference lenses make:Prime Lenses:  Would let you take wonderful facial shot of your girlfriend (boyfriend).  If the lens has a good aperture, you might be able to blur the background so you only get her beautiful face and get rid of the annoying mountain and they tend to be light and small. (Canon EF 50mm f/1.4 is a prime lens -- $350)Super Wide Angle Lenses:  Expands the foreground and compresses the background.  So you'd get a picture of your girlfriend on the car which would both be huge and a lake that would stretch to the horizon and the mountain would look tiny in the far off distance. (Canon EF 14mm f/2.8L is a super wide angle lens -- $1,800)Telephoto Lenses:  Compress the foreground and magnify the distant objects.  You would wind up taking a picture that would magnify the mountain in the background but your girlfriend, car, and lake would either be very small and compressed in the foreground or they wouldn't even come out in extreme telephoto lenses as you'd only get the mountaintop and cut out the rest.  Your girlfriend would also wonder about your relationship at the sight of the humongous lens: good telephotos can be HUGE and heavy! (Canon 400mm EF f/2.8L is a super telephoto lens $6,000)Macro Lenses:  Let you take pictures of very small things and they tend to allow you to focus quite close in on the subject.  You'd walk up to your girlfriend and she'd wonder what you were doing so close to the hood.  You'd give her a peck on the cheek and then you'd close in on the little grasshopper next to her.  With a macro lens, you'd could take a great picture of the little grasshopper and it would fill my frame.  If your girlfriend is like mine, she'd be off the car as soon as she caught glimpse of the bug.  Old stereotype here no disrespect ladies - I know a few that would put me to shame. (Canon EFS 60mm f/2.8 is a macro lens -- $450)Zoom Lenses:  Are any lenses that allow you to shift the focal length.  That is to say I can make it more wide angle or more telephoto.  The 20D comes with a 18 to 55 zoom lens which gives you marginal wide angle and up to 3x telephoto.  Not a bad kit lens but its not USM (Ultrasonic) so autofocus is not as fast and not as accurate and can fail to focus sometimes and its not IS (Image stabilized) which lets you take clearer pictures without a tripod. (Canon EFS 17-85mm IS USM is a zoom lens that covers some wide angle at 17mm and some telephoto at 85mm -- $600).  You can turn the barrel and you can change focal length!! What a wonderful invention but they're more complex with more parts than primes and the extra parts add weight and they generally affect the amount of light they let in (aperture stuff) but you don't have to change lenses and they offer more flexibility.Now bear in mind that if you're out there in the middle of a blooming field in Georgia and start changing lenses, you can get dirt or pollen in the sensor.  I only change my lenses indoors in a non windy environment.Exposure and Shutter Speed:  Exposure is controlled by the ISO sensitivity of the sensor (ISO rating is another arcane film invention basically lower the ISO number the more sensitivity to light).  One of the problems with smaller sensors was noise (graininess) on the pictures at high ISO numbers.  Well not on the 20D the noise is imperceptible to me.  Shutter speed is also controlled by your 20D...and the 20D has a great shutter 5frames per second, up to 1/8000 of a second.  Wow! So you have two out of three big components taken care of here and the 20D is first rate on a ton of other things like custom White balance etc.A note on Aperture.  Its just how much light can come into the lens (the size of the hole). The lower the aperture number f/# on the lense the more light it allows.  Aperture determines depth of field (how much of the foreground + background is in focus) and it constrains shutter speeds.  Now aperture is a function of lens construction -- a 400mm f/2.8 lens is humongous and costs $6,000 while a 70-300mm telephoto f/4.5 to 5.6 is $1,200 but with the 400mm lens (get this)...you can use faster shutters and freeze the action of a quarterback spinning in midair across the field on a night game (or freeze your son as he's swinging a bat in little league:  ball bat and son frozen in midair!).  With the 70 to 300mm, you'd have to use a slower shutter and you'd get blurr and blurry does not make the cover of the USA Today nor brings a smile to grandpa.  On another example, if you've been hiking for a month to take a picture of a sloth that moves at 1cm a year in some god forsaken South American jungle, the 70-300mm lens will weigh allot less and allow you to run faster than the 400mm white monster lens.  If I'm a nature photographer, I'd rather come out with the picture than fall victim to some relocated pigmy tribe because I couldn't run fast enough and have someone years later find my bones still clutching my white 40lb $6,000 lens in the middle of Brazil still attached to my 20D with a flashcard full of razor sharp gorgeously blokehed* pigmy and sloth pictures, ala blair witch project.  So get a lens for what you need -- I guess is what I recommend. (*Blokeh are those out of focus circles of light in the backgrounds of pictures taken with expensive good lenses)A word on Nikon.  There are two camps of photographers these days Canon and Nikon (well there are others like Leica - but if you own a Leica you're probably a pro, don't care about feature battles and are laughing at my gradeschool analysis).  The 20D is more expensive and better chassis feature for feature than the D100 - go compare 8.2megapix vs 6.1 and the list goes from there.  Nikon owners will tell you that their lenses have backwards compatibility 50 years...yes but you'll have to manually focus those lenses and on some of them you have to pay some guy to saw off some metal flaps to make them fit the D100.  Canon EF has been around since 1986 and there are a ton of autofocus lenses out there. EF is the standard lens mount that fits the 20D and there is a newer mount called the EF-S Mount that also fits.  Canon is very conservative in their advertisement as they aim for educated consumers: D100 claims a burst mode of 144 pictures -- yes but on the low quality setting, 20D can do the same if you cut the quality down...you'll hear spot metering, megapixels, focus speed --- you need to read to understand all of this and make a sound decision.  Nikon makes great cameras and I don't want to get into a war.  If you already own a bunch of recent Nikor lenses -- your mind is already made up.  A good friend of mine owns the D70 and another the Digital Rebel and me with the 20D -- we're all happy.  After much review and a ton of reading, I liked the 20D better for my purpose as a personal preference I bought it and am very happy.On crop factors.  Lenses are still stuck in the 35mm film focal length format world and 35mm film is bigger than the sensors on the 20D and this means simply that the EF and EFS lenses turn out more telephoto on the 20D.  So a lens marked 10mm is actually a 16mm (multiply mm times 1.6 to get actual focal length) on a 20D and other small sensor cameras (Rebel and Rebel XT).  The crop 1.6 crop is not extra zoom -- it only appears that way, its actual lost information.  So, to telephoto photographers, this means you carry more weight than you need in physical glass and to wide angle photographers, it means its harder to find lenses that do true wide angle bc the sensor is too small to capture all the information.  EFS was designed so they could make smaller lenses at least so don't lose information but they're still labeled \"old school\" and you still have to multiply.  EFS was designed to take advantage of the smaller sensors on the 10D 20D Digital Rebel and Rebel XT.  The higher end Canon cameras use a 35mm size sensor.  People wonder if Canon will adopt bigger sensors for all lines and if they do, then EFS will probably go the way of the dodo.  On the other hand, bigger sensors are expensive to make so who knows where it will go and the 20D has very low noise at higher ISOs (used to be one of the reasons they thought bigger sensors would prevail -- that and the 35mm mindset and large number of lenses out there for 35mm).  I can't predict the future -- Canon seems to be still investing in both EF and EFS though and I think that for the next 3-6 years you're fine with either EF or EFS.I heard a rumour that Canon is planning to release a new camera between the 20D and their higher end 1Ds around December?  If you must have latest and greatest and have $4,000 to spend you might want to wait.  If true, I'm sure the chassis will cost $2,500 - $3,000 -- just rumours here.  I'm keeping my 20D until I can make money to justify more expensive than this extremely good camera.  In my opinion, this new camera would not supplant the 20D as much as it would provide Canon a more complete EOS Digital line from Digital Rebel all the way up to the 16.7megapix 1Ds -- they'd provide an true entry level Pro Camera in the $2,000 to $3,000 range.  Most interesting to me will be if it has 45pt autofocus and the size of the sensor.  Also interesting, Canon is releasing a new 60mm EFS f/2.8 Macro lens.  Good quality and interesting choice in focal length.  Amazon carries it.  I think Canon is telling us something with the type of EFS lenses they're releasing and the market they are targetting.  Keep watching Canon.Back to my 20D, I've only bought a 50mm f/1.8 lens for $79 and the kit lens and a tripod.  I can't wait to get a USM (ultrasonic silent 0.5 second focusing lens) with IS (Image stabilization) -- if I can only decide what type of photography. But with what I have, I've taken pictures that have floored my friends and everyone who has seen them.  Someone actually said, \"I'll pay you for that picture.\"  And that is a great complement to me and to the 20D and the complement goes to the 20D because my lenses are cheap!

But in normal use you won't notice this. The viewfinder is small, in many cases you just have to trust that it really has done a good job of focus because there isn't enough image for you to see for yourself. I find it quite difficult to be certain that I even have the camera level. It's also not the brightest viewfinder you ever saw.Battery life is very good, even powering an image stabilized lens, I just filled a 1Gb card on a single battery, that's a few hundred images and the battery still isn't showing low.Dust has been a small issue, there are cameras now that will clean their own sensor but this isn't one.

I use Tokina 24-200, Canon 50mm and Sigma 80-400 OS EX lenses, so I do change the lens fairly often, so perhaps dust isn't that big an issue.Switch on is unbelievably fast, slow switch on times have cost me numerous shots with other cameras, with the 20D the camera is on by the time you realize the switch has clicked into place. Speaking of which, on a camera with excellent ergonomics the on-off switch is about the only thing that doesn't come to hand well, but it's not a factor in normal use. Just not perfect.Low light performance has been excellent, the camera will shoot at 800 or even 1600 ASA with no apparent noise. You can even configure it to use 3200ASA, but you get significant noise effects with some faint horizontal lines and grain like effects, though I was shooting under sodium light. Even at 3200ASA the pictures are better than with fast print film under similar conditions.You do need to be mindful that the exposure controls on this camera really do do what they say, you need to keep your eye on the shutter speed and aperture to get the shot you think you want, this isn't an instant camera that will just make the most of it. Most of the time the idiot modes, sport or scenic or whatever, will actually do a good job of picking the right settings. If you are in a hurry then use the built in functions. For example, in sports mode it switches to predictive autofocus, shutter priority and continuous shooting, which are all good choices.The autofocus is excellent, however in programmed modes you need to pay attention to which of the focus zones it has actually selected. If there is something closer to you than the subject you may need to select the correct focus point, fortunately this is very easy to do, you can hit the control and then select the focus point using the joystick, both with your right thumb.Another minor irritation to me is that if you are using the fully auto mode, which does a very good job of most things, it will sometimes select the flash even though the autofocus should tell it that the subject is way out of range. Perhaps I expect too much?Picture quality? Well, unless you have an absolutely perfect lens and need to make 36\" wide posters you are unlikely to find that the camera is a limiting factor. I'm actually waiting to see an Epson R1800 because the current generation of printers can't reproduce the quality I have available with this camera and my lenses.The built in flash is inadequate and the flash metering is soometimes poor, I was taking pictures near a road recently and whenever a reflective sign was in shot the picture was under exposed. Recharge times are pretty poor too, but I think the built in flash should be regarded as an emergency or backup method only, if you are serious then you need a serious flash. I'll be adding either the Speedlite 580EX or a Metz 54 flash in the near future.I'll also be adding an L-series lens in place of the Tokina, the Tokina is OK, but not good enough for my brothers wedding.Would I buy it again? Sure. Will I trade for the next great EOS digital to come on the scene? Unlikely. Maybe if it has a larger viewfinder and a 35mm sensor, but this camera already does way more than I need.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Almost perfect -but not quite", "unixReviewTime": 1118448000, "reviewTime": "06 11, 2005"}

I just did and it is amazing.  I must say, for about five years a use regular digital cameras.  I wish I had gone digital SLR years ago.  I think of all the shots that I've missed because of shutter lag once you go digital SLR you will not go back.One thing about purchasing a digital SLR that you need to keep in mind is.  It's all about the lenses!  If you're buying this camera do yourself a favor get a good piece of glass.  I will have links to sites that have reviews of lenses.This thing will take 24 shots in a row.  That is just so great!  With the 8.2 megapixel, you can print 36 x 24 perfectly.  The images are just huge.  One thing I do like also with his camera, as opposed to the digital rebel.  Is that you can capture a JPEG high Quality and raw image simultaneously.  Now I don't use raw images very much yet, but I will of the future I'm sure.  the rebel is raw and normal quality pictureOne other thing I would recommend in relation to this camera is drop a couple dollars on a good flash.  I've just started recently using an external flash the 580 EX and I must say lighting is where it is at!Now, should you get the Canon 20 D. with the included lens it depends, the lens package is only $100 more.  And it's an okay lens, but the other ones in the Canon family are way better.Info on crop factor-------------------------------What happens, if I understand things correctly, is that a full size sensor capture the same amount of data as a 35mm film would. A sensor with a 1.3 factor means that the 35mm film area is 1.3 times as large as the sensor, and the same with a 1.6 sensor.Think of it as simply chopping off some of the data that a 35mm full-frame sensor would capture. Imagine a ruler, where the 35mm camera would capture the full 12\" stretching across the frame. If you then put a 1.3 sensor camera in the same location and took the same picture (assuming the same lens, camera mounted on the same tripod in the same location relative to the ruler) the camera's picture would only show the middle 9 inches (approximately). Now if both cameras produce the same size files, e.g. 8MB pictures, you have one picture at 8MB showing a full 12 inches and one picture at 8MB showing only the middle 9 inches. If you print them both at the same size, the picture taken with the 1.3 sensor will appear to be larger.However, full-frame sensor cameras usually shoot larger MB pictures, so you lose the 1-to-1 relationship between the two pictures. The full-frame cameras shoot at 12MB or larger, so if you then crop THAT image to be 8MB in size by chopping the outer 1/3 (1/6 from each edge) and you will see the same thing as you see with the 1.3 sensor.So it's not really that the 1.3 sensor magnifies the image, it just APPEARS to magnifiy the image. And since in photography it really is all about appearances, in one sense it does magnify things. But not actually, when everything is put on a 1-to-1 basis, the image isn't actually larger.What that crop factor DOES do, though, is to reduce the size of the image you can get with the same lens. That means that you either have to move back if using the same lens to get the same field of view, or you have to use a shorter lens to get the same field of view from the same location.That is where the 1.3 factor or 1.6 factor becomes important in deciding how to shoot a scene, especially for people who are coming to digital from the film world. So when you put your 50mm lens on a 20D, it becomes effectively a 80mm lens (50mmx1.6=80), with the reduced field of view that an 80mm lens would give. So to get the same field of view that you would get with a 50mm lens on a 35mm film body, you need to put a 32mm lens on a 20D body if you are standing in the same spot as with the film camera.Again, since what we see is of utmost importance in photography, you are actually seeing a magnified image, when both images are printed straight to paper. But if the images are made to be the same size by cropping the larger file to equal the smaller file, there isn't really magnification.-----------------------------------just fyiOkay, hope this helps have some fun-and-get-it-done!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This camera totally rocks I'm blown away", "unixReviewTime": 1132963200, "reviewTime": "11 26, 2005"}

One minor quibble that I have with this camera is its lack of spot metering.  In some circumstances this would come in very handy but 99% of the time, center weighted would be fine.I would strongly recommend the extension grip for this camera.

I just want to add a few real-user observations:1) The 20D is a very solid camera in your hands.  From the hefty weight to the sizable size and the solid grip, it makes you feel you are holding a real SLR, unlike with the Digital Rebel (EOS 300D).  BTW this is assembled in Japan instead of Taiwan (300D).2) The camera is very fast.  It's not \"instant on\" like the Nikon 70D but it's still damned fast with very littel shutter lag.  When you use a high-speed CF card, the shot-to-shot performance is satisfying for most fast-action scenarios.3) Great auto focus, great exposure, and great picture quality.  Canon's expertise in combining optics and electronics once again shines through.  The prints made from this baby, and in part thanks to the 8MP resolution, is just total pro-quality.4) The kit lens is not really that good, unlike what Nikon bundles in their kits.  It's still a high-quality lends but the max aperture is slow and the lens itself looks and feels cheap.5) The old photography wisdom about how an expensive camera does not turn an amateur into a pro overnight still applies.  At least you can impress your girlfriend with cr*p that looks like gold for a second there.  :)  (sorry didn't mean to sound sexist...)The EOS 20D is one AWESOME digital SLR.

I LOVE this camera.  The 10D was felt by many to have focusing issues and though I did not have any significant problem with my 10D in that regard the 20D represents a substantial improvement in this area.  Canon still is not offering (in this price range) a camera with eye control or 45 focusing points, BUT the nine focusing points that ARE offered are well placed and the camera focuses quickly and surely resulting in tack sharp photos.The pictures this camera takes are simply beyond belief.  Beautifully saturated, tack sharp, NO, and I mean NO noise at 400 or below and barely discernible noise all the way up to 1600 ISO.  For all practical purposes 1600 ISO is an entirely usable speed resulting in fantastic pictures.  What Canon has accomplished in reducing noise and increasing pixel density proves that they are, for now, the technology leader.Another big advantage over the 10D is the instant on feature which does not leave you sitting there helplessly until the camera turns on.  That happens instantly!  A new flash system, ETTL II is a vast improvement over the 10D.  And, to my eye, there is an improved dynamic range with slightly less blown highlights.The in camera processing results in far more pleasing pictures than the previous 10D or Digital Rebel.  This camera has a greater burst (more pictures quicker) that the previous 10D.Now there is currently an issue with mirror lockups reported by probably 10% - 20% of all owners.  If you encounter this problem before you update the firmware then simply take the battery out of the camera, reinsert it, and you're good to go.  Canon has issued a fix and it is available on their web site.  It completely remedies the problem so, not to worry!One of the greatest things about digital photography is the ability to build a digital dark room for next to nothing. With the included Photoshop Elements you are well on your way to producing pictures that you could only have imagined in the pre-digital days. I am able to recoup pictures that I never would have considered salvageable before this camera.The other thing I like about Canon is the lens system which IMO is second to none. Also, Canon continues to innovate at a furious pace driving the price of these digital cameras relentlessly downward.I sold my 10D to purchase this camera and for me it represented a significant improvement more than justifying the cost of the upgrade.So, I LOVE the camera.

The 20D is also my second SLR, my first SLR I still have after 23 years, but more for sentimental reasons, these days.I did a lot of research before deciding on this camera.  Original research started about a year before the purchase, but, at that time did not have a need for DSLR until now.  My primary reason for going to DSLR is for the low-noise as it is very important for astrophotography.Similar to another reviewer, I also considered the 350D and the Nikon D70.  I had some advantage regarding the D70 as my brother owns one.  The heated decision came between the 350D and the 20D.  Size/weight were only a minor consideration for me, but I really did like the metal body of the 20D.  I found sites with samples of astrophotos from the 350D as well as the D70.  The D70 has an inherent heat problem for long exposures and develops a \"hot area\" in the upper left portion of the images.  The noise reduction it has is effective for reducing this, but I just didn't like the fact that it existed.  Comparing 350D results to 20D, well, one would be pressed to notice the differences.  However, in looking closely at review sites (such as dpreview), even they admitted the clarity on the 20D edged out the 350D (what is nice, you can see for yourself in their images).  No, not a big difference at all, but I am wanting the best of the 2 at this point.In the end, my decision was for the 20D mostly because this is the very camera Canon themselves used to create a camera purely for astrophotography - the 20Da.  My thought is, if Canon chose this, there is a reason.  I did not want the 20Da, however, as I plan to use the 20D for \"normal\" shooting, as well...but I was sold on the 20D.Having used it for more than a week, I put it through some gruesome tests...including, of course, long exposures.  I wanted to check for hot pixels at 30 sec exposures.  The short version is: I checked with the Canon 5D results on dpreview and my results are on par with it...and the 5D price is nearing 3 times the 20D price.Also, in more tests, I have found the 20D noise reduction has improved (I am guessing with the newer firmware my camera has) over what the results are on the dpreview site.Oh, and of course (for fun) I compared results from the point and shoots I have/have had.  I still have results from my A40 and S1 and, at ISO400 the point and shoots are blown so far out of the water you just can't find them.I am a very happy person.

The main takeaway for an amateur is that if you choose to learn a lot more about photography, you're not going to need to upgrade your camera to keep up -- it's there and waiting for you to advance.But forgetting all that, there are two good reasons for stepping up to this camera over the lesser consumer ones (if you can afford it) even if you're never going to use all those features.1. Picture quality -- absolutely awesome.  Even if you do nothing more than learn what 3 or 4 of the different point and shoot modes do, you'll feel like a pro with the quality of images that come out of this.  There's one dial to turn to choose your mode -- you can keep it on the all purpose green mode, or switch to a portrait (which gives that cool blurred background look), or sports mode, or night mode.  There are a couple others, but these are the main ones I use.  The images are simply far superior to anything I took with mid-range cameras ($500ish) in the past.2. Speed.  My biggest complaint with lesser cameras is the time it takes (1) to turn on, (2) from pressing the shutter to getting the picture (the kids are in a different spot than when I started the picture) and (3) the write time between pictures.  Those are completely solved with this camera.  It turns on right away.  The \"shutter lag\" (2) is negligible.  And it has a buffer to store a number of pictures in cache to write out to the disk so you can rapid fire pictures in an action situation.For family photos, this is a pretty big investment.  But given that these memories are \"priceless\" and given the quantity of pictures we print -- if I look at it on a monthly basis it seems worth it to step up from the mid-range consumer cameras.Downsides to consider (relative to lower end cameras):- This is big -- it's a lot to carry around- It's clearly expensive and you'll probably want to add on to it with an extra lens, a flash, high speed storage card, etc.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A review for amateur photographers like me", "unixReviewTime": 1115164800, "reviewTime": "05 4, 2005"}

I will not go into all the technical details about this camera, as this information is available in the product description and in other reviews.  I will say that this is not a camera for one just getting into digital photography.  This is a (near) professional quality instrument and has so many options that one not grounded in digital photography would be quickly overwhelmed.  It is also higher priced than the typical consumer-grade digital camera, with an asking price of right arund $1400 dollars at the time of this writing.  Once you add a couple of filters, a telephoto zoom lens, and some other accessories, you quickly have an investment of over $2,000 dollars.  Thus, this is not a camera for the masses.If you are looking for a camera that provides you with all the versitility of a SLR quality film camera, you have come to the right place.  Canon's 20D will absolutely overwhelm you with its extensive options!  This is truly a versitile instrument that will allow you to do virtually anything in photography!  I don't think it is an exaggeration to say that the Canon 20D is the best camera for its price in its class. It blows the competition away.The camera body has a firm heavy feel to it.  It is not a miniature digital camera at all.  It fills and fits the hand nicely, much like a SLR should feel.  The buttons, wheels, and controls are all within finger reach, but there are so many options that one has a pretty good learning curve to be proficient with the camera.  By the way, the instruction manual is well over 150 pages, and it does a mostly adequate job of introducing the camera controls to the operator.  Still, it has taken me several weeks of use and review to learn the camera's many features and then remember them so that the operations are automatic.The pictures I have taken are very pleasing.  One can shoot in low light, bright light and all conditions in-between.  A flash is available and pops up automatically if desired for additional light.  This camera takes excellent pics in low-light conditions.The lens that comes with the camera is acceptable and I am pleasd with the sharpness of the images produced.  Other reviewers have stated that compared to fixed focal length lenses, such as the 50 mm, the variable zoom lens is not as sharp.  My view is that the lens provided is very adequate for virtually all applications, however, if the operator wants the very sharpest images possible, especially for portrait work, then perhaps a fixed focal length lens is beneficial.  I purchased a EF-S 28-135 IS lens for a telephoto zoom, and am happy with it.  Again, the quality of the zoom does not approach that of the Canon \"L\" series lenses, but then how many consumers can afford a single lens that is over $4,000 dollars?  From my perspective as an amateur that shoots a lot of images, I think the 20D is more than adequate for my needs.I highly recommend this camera to any amateur photographer that seeks a highly versitile top-quality camera that is a definite cut above the rest.

Sure, it's big and heavy, but it's really fast (shutter release as well as focusing) and the low light performance is fantastic - all critical for taking pictures of kids at play. My main issue with my Nikon 5700 is slow focusing (esp. in low light) and dismal flash performance (with built in flash). This camera has no such issue. In low light it uses the flash for AF assist.Compared to the 300D (which is a great camera too), the 300D feels like a toy. The plastic body of the 300D just doesn't feel as good as the metal body of the 20D. But the main reason I got this is for the low noise photos at high ISO settings.You cannot use the LCD as a viewfinder. This is probably the case with all digital SLRs (I've only tried a few - the reviews usually assume you already know about such things and don't mention it). This means you'll not be able to take well framed shots from strange angles.Finally, be prepared to spend a lot more. The 18-55 EF-S is an okay lens, but you'll soon start wishing for more. A kit with the EF-S 18-85 IS USM will be a better value - but I can't seem to find it anywhere.Anyway, be prepared to spend a lot more. An extra battery or two (few things worse than a digital camera with no power), lenses (unless you already have a good collection of Canon lenses), filters, flash. The good thing is, other than the battery, you don't need to rush out and buy all the rest of it now. This is a camera to grow into as you learn, and you can pick up a piece or two as you go on.

Buy a 20D.  As soon as possible.  You will be thrilled.  There is no doubt that it is among the best cameras the world has ever seen.  I did my research before deciding to buy a 20D.  I looked seriously at the Nikon D70, another excellent digital SLR camera and a fair bit cheaper than the 20D, but I chose the 20D for its ruggedness, slightly larger 8mp sensor, and outstanding autofocus.What is amazing about this camera?  Put it on automatic and squeeze the shutter release.  In a second you have taken 5 shots.  You can take 20 in four seconds, each 8 megapixels in size while the autofocus tracks your running toddler.  It feels GREAT in your hand, very sturdy and not overly heavy.  Perhaps  a tad bulky compared to the digital camera you may be used to.  But I find it a joy to hold and use.It can speed up to ISO 3200 without introducing excessive noise into the image and at 1600 and 800, noise is almost unnoticeable.  That means you can take handheld photos without flash indoors in the evening under ambient room light conditions (the 50mm mentioned below, with its large maximum aperture helps too in this regard).You could spend days researching lenses and accessories.  If you are just wading in to high-end amateur photography, let me make some quick and dirty suggestions:The kit lens (EF-S 18-55mm) is a very good lens for the insanely cheap price of $100.  The EFS 17-85 which pros rave about is pricey at $600 and you don't need the 55-85 range much I find -- you will probably consider a decent telephoto (like a 70-300mm) to be a better use of your cash.  You may well grow tired of the 18-55 eventually, but it does give you access to wide angle shots at a cheap price.You absolutely MUST buy the ($75) 50mm f1.8.  It is a truly outstanding lens for headshots and portraits.  It has fantastic depth of field control allowing you to achieve a nice background blur, and is very very sharp within the depth of field.  You will use this lens a lot.  Some say it's cheaply made.  Probably, but it works wonders and the price is definitely right.  50mm was standard on analog SLRs supposedly due to its rough equivalence to how the human eye observed a scene.  On the 20D it becomes an 80mm lens due to the 1.6x crop factor, and at that length becomes the perfect portrait lens in my view.If you want to photograph ships, houses and palaces, the EF-S 10-22mm f3.5 is a treasure that'll set you back $800.  It's definitely not a good general purpose lens, but how cool is it to have a wide angle zoom?You do NOT need a high speed compact flash card, but you DO need a big one.  If you have a 4x 512MB CF, keep it and it will work well with the 20D.  A 256MB card will fill up pretty fast as you will become addicted to firing off several shots at once.  Sure the 1GB cards are down in price considerably, but don't throw out your old 256 or 512s.

Well, I've now tried both and here's my assessment of the 20d.What I like about this camera:- Very fast all the way around- Nice look and size to the camera- 8MP CMOS sensor is great- I generally like the Canon lenses better than Nikon'sWhat needs improvement:- Flash pictures are very often underexposed and not consistent- Mirror click is louder than on previous models, making unobtrusive shots difficult- 18-55mm lens in kit looks and feels cheap- Camera seems to lock up often (probably an early firmware bug that will be fixed)Overall a camera with great potential, but I'm going to go with the D70 until Canon fixes the flash and lockup issues.  The flash is probably the deal-killer for me - it takes worse flash pictures than my Canon S400, especially for quick, casual shots (a $1500 camera should do better!).

It solves the problem of wide-angle coverage in the 1.6 FOVCF very nicely. As others have pointed out, the mechanical build and optical quality (with 3 Aspherical elements and 1 Super-UD) probably deserve an \"L\" stamp and a red ring. This lens appears to be of almost identical build, quality and size as the EF 17-40mm f/4.0 L USM. Even uses the same 77mm filter size as most of the L's. Overall sharpness is excellent, with maybe a little softness towards the corners at 10mm, but I've seen comparisons with other ultra-wide zooms like the Sigma and the Canon blows them away! CA is well controlled too. There is slight Barrel and Pincushion distortions present at the low and high ends, but less than would be expected for a lens this wide. All in all this is one of the best wide-angle zooms available.The major criticism of this lens usually comes down to; \"well, how long will Canon continue to make 1.6 FOVCF cameras?\" or \"Someday I might upgrade to a Full Frame camera, then what will I do with this lens?\" I doubt very seriously that Canon will do away with the APS-C cameras any time soon. My reasoning is that:1. Canon just came out with the Full Frame 5D at the $3000 price point. Introducing a FF camera to replace the 20D at $1500 would kill the 5D after only a few months.2. Having the EF-S lens line already established almost guarantees keeping the 1.6 format - mostly because of this lens. To be able to use the EF-S 10-22mm, a chip can't really go any bigger than 1.6 since this seems to be the limit of the useable coverage. Using a 1.5 or 1.4 sensor for example would probably start to introduce significant fall-off at the corners of the larger chip.As I am writing this, the PMA conference is only four days away. My prediction is that Canon will announce a replacement for the 20D that will, in essence be a 1.6 FOVCF version of the 5D. They will probably increase the (already excellent) density of the 20D's CMOS by shrinking pixel size down to around 5 micron yielding something around the 10 mega-pixel range to compete with the Nikon D200. Maybe they will call the camera the 50D after the 5D since they can't really use the name 30D because D30 was already used.In any case, my point is that the 1.6 APS-C format will likely be around for some time to come, until the point where the FF price point drops enough to warrant discontinuing the xxD line. Even then, when that happens, doesn't mean you'll throw your 20D in the trash! You'll still want to keep using it and/or sell it, and having this lens will significantly increase its usefulness or resale value.Now, having said all that, this is the only EF-S lens I plan on buying. From the reviews I've read, the other EF-S lenses are of significantly lesser quality, and all of your other lens needs can be met with standard EF lenses anyway, APS-C or otherwise. Plus you get the option to buy L glass.So, bottom line is buying this particular EF-S lens for a 20D or XT is a no-brainer. It's the best solution for wide angle in this format. Hesitating to buy it because \"I might get a FF camera someday\" is also nonsensical. What I might do in the future is just that, for the future.

And I have no doubt that the Sigma ultra wide zoom is even worse.  But based on the comments I read I wasn't prepared for the results this lens produces.I'm not going to boast about how long I've been taking photos.  But for the benefit of those who are new to this stuff let me summarize.  There are no bad macro lenses (not even Sigma).  There are virtually no bad telephoto lenses.  There aren't even many bad telephoto zooms anymore.  Not surprisingly, Canon's L lenses in these categories are excellent and so are most of their non-L lenses and everybody else's lenses too.  Low dispersion, aspherics, apochromatic correction--these days, everybody's got 'em.But just as there are no bad 80-200mm lenses, there are no really exceptional wide angle zooms.  Read the comments on Canon's $1600, 16-35 L lens.  Its OK but neither the original or the new \"improved\" model is spectacular.  These lenses always have barrel distortion at the wide end, soft corners  and vignetting.  Some of this has to do with ultra-wides being used with digital sensors but the fact remains.OK, so I decided to go digital.  Since the 5D didn't even have a dust removal feature I decided to get a couple Rebels.  Picture quality from the Rebels is very similar to the 20D/30D and I'm not going to hammer nails with them so Rebels are fine.If you want any sort of wide angle with a Rebel or 20D/30D/40D, the 10-22 lens is pretty much it.  Besides, Canon's 20, 24, 28 are nothing special so why not get the zoom and if need be, use software like DxO to correct any lens flaws.  That was the plan but this lens just isn't sharp enough at the edges or in the corners.  It reminded me of a Spiratone/Sun 24-40mm zoom I had many years ago.  It was revolutionary, super convenient and very poor.I guess it depends what you are looking for.  If you are a real estate agent needing an adjustable wide angle for interiors and your images are for the web this lens would be fabulous.  It focuses very fast and its silent.  For a Canon lens its pretty small and light.  But make a crisp 8x10 print from an image taken at the 10mm setting?  I don't see how.I know everybody raves about this lens.  That's why I bought it.  I figured, in all those reviews there had to be somebody who knew what really good image quality was.  There were so few negative comments, I figured I'd take a chance.  Maybe I got a bad one but when something is this far off the mark I think I'll pass.GOOD NEWS - I'm delighted (and surprised) to report the Tokina 12-24 lens is really quite good.  No, you can't use it wide open and it barrels a bit, but at f/8 its downright sharp, right to the corners(!)  I know its not a Canon lens but give it a try.

{"reviewerID": "A121X1GOQV01DW", "asin": "B0002Y5WXE", "reviewerName": "Gwac", "helpful": [32, 33], "reviewText": "(4.5 of 5 stars)This was my third lens purchase, after getting the kit lens with my Rebel XS and the 50mm f/1.8. Why did I choose this lens? Well for one, I was suffering from cheap lens syndrome. While I enjoyed the results I was getting from my other lenses, they weren't much fun to work with because of the cheap build quality. More importantly perhaps, I was finding myself at 18mm on my kit lens more than 50% of the time. While I was generally happy with those results, I was disappointed by the barrel distortion, CAs and flare, and wanted something wider that would give me more flexibility.I read many reviews of the 10-22mm, as well as the Tokina 12-24mm f/4 and 11-16mm f/2.8. All were received pretty positively. I didn't consider Sigma or Tamron options because of apparent quality control issues. So why did I pick this one?1) Focal length/zoom range: As far as focal lengths were concerned, I wanted something that would give me a fair amount of flexibility, since I'm not too keen on switching lenses frequently. At the wide end, it really does help to have a zoom. The 10mm (16mm equiv) setting is pretty extreme and can be useful, but often the intermediate focal lengths (12-17mm) are more appropriate. Furthermore, at 22mm the resulting perspective could be described as \"wide-normal\" - things still appear pretty natural. Therefore, you get a lens that dabbles with extreme perspective on the wide end while offering a fairly normal perspective on the long end.Those who are buying the lens purely for the widest setting may be more attracted to the Tokina 11-16, as it gives you nearly an extra stop in maximum aperture and is apparently a bit sharper than the Canon.2) Distortion: Some have commented that they don't use the 10-16mm range as much because of distortion. I imagine these are the same people who are using the lens as a substitute for backing up. In fact, the Canon offers the lowest amount of optical (barrel) distortion in its class - much smaller than most standard zooms at their widest setting. It is trivial to correct in post-processing. Therefore, I can only assume that the complaints are about the perspective distortion, which is the result of using the ultra-wide focal lengths. This is the whole point of an ultrawide lens!! If you don't want perspective distortion, back up and zoom in! Or if you're looking for parallel lines buy a full frame camera and the $2500 tilt-shift 17mm lens. Problem solved.3) Handling of flare: This is the single characteristic of this lens that I appreciate the most. Based on samples I've seen of the Tokinas and other 3rd party lenses, the Canon is the hands down winner on managing flare. With this lens it is possible to have the sun directly inside or just outside the frame with very little consequence to the final image. Even when you do manage to get flare in the frame, it is fairly minimal and not very unsightly. This is a very desireable characteristic of an ultrawide lens, since lots of light sources will find their way into your huge field of view. I find myself shooting into the sun even more than I normally would because of it. Another benefit of this characteristic is that there is little incentive to buy or use the bulky lens hood.4) Chromatic Aberrations: Compared to the Tokinas, this lens has minimal CAs at the wide end that many will be able to live with in their JPEGs. If you want to get rid of them, it is again trivial to do by shooting RAW and post-processing.5) Light weight: Despite being about the same size, the Canon is lighter compared to the Tokinas (13 oz. vs. 20 oz.). I feel that it is ideally balanced on my small Rebel XS, and therefore appreciate the weight advantage.6) Colors: Is it just me or does this lens render beautifully saturated colors? Wonderful green trees and gorgeous blue skies.Complaints:1) Price: The Canon is significantly more expensive than 3rd party alternatives, which is not unusual. Maybe more annoying, though, is that it is priced similarly to the full-frame equivalent, the 17-40mm L. Basically you're paying the same price for a lens with less glass and poorer build quality (though the build is not bad). As with the EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 Canon has put \"L\" glass in a consumer body and charges \"L\" prices because there's no in-house competition. On the bright side, compared to the Nikon equivalents (12-24mm and 10-24mm), which are around $900, this is cheap.I got this lens during rebate season, but I would have hesitated to spend more than $700 on it with the good 3rd party alternatives available.2) Sharpness: I must have had unreasonably high expectations in terms of sharpness. The lens produces excellent micro-contrast at normal viewing sizes (very good for all but the largest prints). However, looking at the images at full size on your monitor will reveal somewhat inferior pixel level detail. The results do respond pretty well to sharpening, though. Sounds like the Tokina 11-16 might be a little better in terms of pixel-level detail, but I wouldn't expect it to be too noticeable. For the best sharpness across the frame I try to keep the aperture between f/5.6 and f/8, and never smaller than f/11. Larger than f/5.6 the center is fine but the edges degrade. The only serious complaint is the extreme corners, but this is typical in almost all wide-angle lenses. In any case, I am of the opinion that sharpness is an over-emphasized lens characteristic. I will take the contrast, handling of flare, bokeh and low distortion of this lens over greater sharpness any day.3) Vignetting: This is most noticeable wide open at 10mm, but again is fairly easily corrected. Not a big deal to me.4) Not really a complaint, but a warning: The lens isn't very compatible with the built-in flash except at the longest focal lengths. A lens shadow appears at shorter focal lengths, and the flash is unevenly distributed anyway so the effect is pretty undesirable. Better keep the kit lens around when you want to use flash.Overall, I'm very happy with this lens. It has more or less displaced my kit lens, as I use my 50mm f/1.8 for any short tele needs. I should note, however, that dealing with wide focal lengths requires a lot more skill as a photographer in almost every respect: composition, selection of aperture, focusing, and metering. This is not a point-and-shoot lens. It is tempting to use the 10mm setting a lot but you will find with time that it does not suit all subjects equally well - Some of my favorite photos were taken at intermediate focal lengths, where the IQ of the lens really shines.This is a great photographic tool that will challenge you to be more creative. You will get the best results with this lens when you are thinking outside the box. In fact, some of my favorite photos from this lens are when I use it for close-ups. It's not by any means a macro lens, but the perspective distortion as well as the large apparent depth of field can make for some nice close-up shots with the right background. Regardless of the brand, I whole-heartedly recommend a wide-angle zoom to those who enjoy capturing big scenes or getting close to their subjects. It's challenging to use but fun and rewarding.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "An excellent but expensive ultrawide zoom", "unixReviewTime": 1242086400, "reviewTime": "05 12, 2009"}

My requirements for a filter were:No \"vignetting\" caused by the filter at 10mm.No reduction in image quality.Must have front accessory threads that would allow me to clip on canon standard lens caps.I eventually just gave up searching and decided to try theHoya 77mm HMC UV Digital Multi-Coated Slim Frame Glass Filterfilter that everyone seemed to be buying for this lens. This filter produced no vignetting even at 10mm at f/22. Images taken with and without the filter are almost identical. Image quality reduction is negligible with this filter. You may experience extra reflections from the filter when pointed at a bright light source, but I have not found this to be a problem in real world use. My canon lens cap attaches nicely to the filter and does not pop off randomly.I also own theB+W 65-073102 77mm Neutral Density 0.9-8x Filter #103which meets all my requirements listed above. I suspect any B+W filter with the newer F-Pro mount will not cause vignetting on this lens (because all my F-Pro B+W filters are precisely the same thickness) and may be your best choice optically.B+W 77mm Clear UV Haze with Multi-Resistant Coating (010M)is likely an excellent choice if you don't mind parting with the extra cash when compared to the Hoya filter.Also, I can stack the UV and ND filters on this lens causing only very slight vignetting at 10mm and no vignetting around 11mm.Awesome lens.

There is nothing else on the market to compete with it (nothing at all), and it produces supurb images. It isn't an f/2.8 lens, but it is close enough for most uses. The competition from Tamron is a full stop slower, not as sharp, and is awful in dim light compared to the Canon 10-22 lens (sorry, Tamron fans, but the Tamron lens isn't even playing in the same ballpark).I use this lens on a 30D body, and I always keep it on hand if I'm doing any indoor, or tight group photography. It is the perfect solution to the perennial problem of not having enough room to capture all the kids at a birthday party in one shot because your back is up against a wall. This lens will just about get your toes into the picture at the widest setting, yet delivers tack sharp, colorful, and contrasty images. The auto focus is spot on, silent, and fast.

You simply can't beat this lens with anything available on the market today.That beng said, do not try to convince yourself that this will make a good \"walkaround\" lens. It isn't. Even at max length, it is far too short to live on your camera as a standard lens. You need this lens, even if you don't know it yet, but it should not be your first lens, as it will only be used 15 to 20 percent of the time. At those times, it's performance simply cannot be equaled by any other zoom lens on a 1.6 crop factor camera. You will be amazed by the quality of this lens. It rivals the performance of modern prime lenses, presents a bright viewfinder image, and delivers the goods in tight situations.This is not a casual assessment, nor a Canon \"feel good\" moment on my part. I developed my first B&W; contact prints in 1964, in my own darkroom at the age of 9 (my parents were concerned:)), and have been an avid photographer ever since. Small, medium, and large format cameras and lenses have passed through my hands over the years, and Canon has become my favorite small format brand. Still, Canon builds some trash lenses that should be avoided. The 10-22 USM is not one of them :).Before you go out and buy this lens, you should already own the EF-S 17-55mm IS f/2.8 lens. That is the king of 1.6 crop factor standard lenses, and includes the awesome Canon IS feature. It will end up being mounted on your camera 80% of the time, and keep you smiling after every shoot. Get that lens first. Then, get the 10-22mm lens. Then, let your imagination run wild, and plan on serious telephoto lenses for the future. Trust me or not, the two lenses mentioned above will provide you with photographic tools that will astound you. Get them in your kit as soon as you can afford them.A little warning about either lens.... Some here will argue the point, but with either lens, get a GOOD quality UV filter that is multi-coated on both sides, and built extra thin to avoid vignetting at wide lens settings. A good filter will cost a little less than one hundred Dollars, and can cost up to one hundred forty Dollars. The minimum brand would be Hoya Pro 1 multi coated filters, and the ante goes up from there.Everything else is garbage, including the Canon \"sharp cut\" filter that costs less than fifty bucks. No kidding, no conjecture. If you use cheap filters, you will never see what your lens can really do. Ever. No doubt that many will respond with claims that their twenty Dollar filter works just fine, but they simply don't know any better, and have never used their expensive equipment to it's full potential. It's akin to a Chevy owner passing judgement on a Mercedes Benz. The Chevy might feel real good, but until you own the Mercedes, you just have no clue.Bottom line.... Make sure that the quality of your filters exceed the quality of your lenses. Yes, at a hundred bucks a pop for a 77mm filter, it hurts, but you will never regret it. Also, Amazon does not stock lens hoods for all non L Canon lenses. The price is stupid high for those hoods, but they make a night and day difference in in picture quality. Whenever you order a non L Canon lens, find a web seller who has the hood in stock, and get it right now. Again, you will never regret owning it.That's it for my review/rant. Buy this lens. Buy the 17-55 IS f/2,8 first. Buy the lens hoods for both.

The 2 things I liked the most about what I read were the claims that Canon appeared to be using \"L\" glass, or near-\"L\" glass in this lens, and of course the main feature of having an ultra-wide angle capability with a 1.6 APS-C camera like my EOS 50D. I can say now after some field testing that this lens gets a 5-out-of-5 stars on both of these accounts.Crisp focus and tack sharp images seem to be trivial to achieve with this quiet USM AF lens. I found the best 50D lens micro adjustment on my camera to be +3, but also found +0 to be quite acceptable, using the LCD monitor/moire pattern tuning technique at both ends of the zoom range. What REALLY tooted my horn however was the new found capability to take shots that were simply not achieveable before with my 28mm lens. Whole rooms in the house became one-shot deals, as opposed to the cumbersome image stitching technique. Groups of people near by - no problem getting them all into 1 shot. Landscape challenges - a snap without having to back up and up some more, and still wind up stitching multiple images together. Of course, everything written about straight-line distortion at the 10mm end of the zoom is true, but not to an excess, and in my opinion is MORE than offset by the capability to simply \"get the shot all at once\". An indoor 6 story atrium that previously took 6 stitched photo's to capture - now easily captured in 1 shot.Focus was achieveable at a tiny bit over 4\" from the front of the lens. No IS on this lens, which I missed while trying some low-light shots (I kept waiting for IS to kick in out of habit, since all my other lenses are blessed with this feature), but this is only a concern on extreme close-up's, which is not generally what you'd use this lens for anyway.The lens has an AF/MF switch of course, and is only usable on certain camera's that are compatible with EF-S type lenses (there is tons of online info about that to be read elsewhere). The filter size is 77mm. There is a light hood available from Canon, which I don't own yet, and I've read that it's marginally beneficial for blocking light since it's so small in order to accomodate wide angle zooming without getting in the way. I'll still buy one and put it on for extra front-end lens protection at around $14. It's easy to bump in to things and a lens hood makes a lot of sense for that reason alone. Anyone who's ever bent the metal of a filter after lightly bumping in to something, and then struggled with filter removal, lens cap fitting, etc., will know just what I mean.I took some test shots with the built-in flash, and the 10-22mm lens does block the lower 5-10% portion of the picture at wider angle zooms. I was able to compensate for this in most shots by pointing the camera downward a bit more. Still, I'd recommend an external flash when using this lens, to take care of this interference and of course to get far superior bounce flash shots. There was no issue with the lens blocking any output from a camera mounted EX flash.No lens creep on this lens. The overall lens length does not change with zooming. The zoom ring is snug, but turns smoothly, as does the focus ring, which can be turned after AF'ing for any fine tuning of the focus. The subject end of the lens does NOT TURN when zooming, which is great for circular polarizers and other filters that need to stay oriented. The lens length is 4\" (with a UV filter attached) from the front of the lens to the camera body face.At first I thought this lens might be a specialty lens that I would only use when I needed whole room shots or was met with other wide angle challenges, but with an effective 35mm range on an APS-C camera, the quality of this glass makes it a candidate for a lot more uses as well, enabling quick access with a twist of the zoom ring to any action that comes in \"close\", or to capture 2 subjects that are not conveniently side-by-side, as is sometimes the case with candid photo's.I have to admit that I'm writing this review after taking less than 300 photo's with this lens, but the image quality and jaw dropping access to amazingly wide \"views\" that I've never had the ability to capture in one shot with a dSLR compelled me to brag \"now\" about this lens. If I encounter anything noteworthy after taking some more test shots under various conditions, I'll amend this post.In all honesty, it's hard to imagine anyone who has ever been challenged by a wide angle shot not immediately falling in love with this gem once they get in to the field with it.

I looked at the lens in the store along with the Sigma 12-24 and I was in total awe of what I saw though the view finder with the Canon 10-22. This is an ultra wide angle lens that is incredible. I went home and thought about where I would use this lens and determined that I would use it quite a bit. I went ahead and bought the lens and I continue to be more impressed with it every time I use it. I have used the lens for both close-up (which can give you some very interesting distortion shots)and wide angle shots with great success.The 10-22mm is equivalent to 16-35mm field of view using a canon 20D which is not a full frame sensor. With a minimum focal distance of .24m (about 9.5 inches) you can get very close to objects and still get alot of focal width in the photo. There is incredible clarity in the lens. The photos I have taken are very clear with only a slight hint of softening at the corners at 10mm; everything else is sharp after that. There is a little barrel distortion at 10mm but everything else up to 22mm is nice.  I have not gotten any light flare in my photos.  The Ultrasonic motor is very quiet. The depth of field is outstanding. A slim UV filter helps prevent some slight vignetting at 10mm. With a maximum aperture that ranges from f/3.5 to f/4.5, the Canon EF-S 10-22mm f/3.5-4.5 USM Lens is a medium speed lens. I would recommend using a tripod if you are at all unsure about your ability to hold the camera still for action shots with this lens. The lens it's self is fairly light weight. If you are going to use filters the lens requires 77mm.The lens can produce some interesting distortion shots if you are taking close-ups and are not perpendicular to the object. For close-up shots with out distortion it is best to be perpendicular to the object.Inside the lens housing there are three aspherical lens elements and a Super UD element that produce clear vibrant shots.

It won't work on an SLR with a \"full-size\" sensor like the Canon 5D.Most SLRs come with a standard 17-55 or 17-85mm zoom that has a maximum field of view equal to a 28mm wide angle lens on a full-frame SLR.  On the cameras it fits, the 10-22mm lens give you the same field of view as a 16 - 35mm zoom on a normal 35mm SLR.  It's the wide end of things that brings a whole new world to photography.

Frary \"Gochugogi\"", "helpful": [16, 16], "reviewText": "The ultra wide zoom has been a mainstay of pros, especially photojournalists, since the early 1990s. Sweeping landscapes, operation in tight quarters and ease of hand holding are hallmarks of this range. The EF-s 10-22 3.5-4.5 USM is the first lens to bring this range to APS-C (1.6X crop) cameras like the 7D, 60D, 70D and Rebel.CONSTRUCTION: My initial impression was it's a little plasticy and zoom and focus rings are slightly coarse and stiff. After a year, it loosened up nicely but is still a notch below the smoothness of my EF-s 15-85 3.5-5.6 IS USM. However, it's light and petite: easy to slip in a coat pocket and ideal for travel or hiking. The metal mount and polycarbonate barrel make it durable yet lightweight. The front element moves slightly during operation so a UV filter is needed to seal the front from dust.AUTO FOCUS: Ring-type USM drives an internal lens group and, thus, AF blazes and is silent to human ears. The front element doesn't rotate during focus and zoom operations. It has FTM, allowing manual focus without switching out of AF mode. This AF design is optimized for stills and not ideal for video: the built-in mics on my 60D and 70D picked up a high pitched stutter from the motor and contrast focus is jerky during video recording. The workaround is to use an external mic and/or focus manually. If video is your main thing, buy theCanon EF-S 10-18mm f/4.5-5.6 IS STMinstead as the STM drive is stepless and silent to the camera mic.OPTICAL PERFORMANCE: Basically, this lens features optical quality of an L series wide zoom in a prosumer barrel. Wide open, this zoom is sharp and contrasty in the middle of the frame with slight softening towards edges. The wide side is the sharpest with slight degradation as you zoom towards 22mm. Sharpness across the frame improves as you stop down. By F8 it is pin sharp from edge to edge. I'm going for increased depth of field for landscapes and cityscapes, so I leave this lens at F8 most of the time. I only shoot wide open for occasional low light snaps.Distortion is well corrected. There is a wee bit of barreling at the wide end and slight pincushion ate the long end. But less distortion than my EF-s 15-85 3.5-5.6 IS USM and a little better than the 17-40 4L USM. Like any wide angle optic, you need to compose carefully to avoid perspective distortion, e.g., noses appearing too large or buildings falling over.Chromatic aberration is a reality with zooms and this one is not exempt, with magenta fringing along high contrast edges. e.g., tree branches against a bright sky. However, it is mild and easy to remove in DPP, LR or Aperture. In normal light you will never notice magenta fringing.Flare is well controlled for a zoom: no problems with sunsets or streetlights. Nevertheless, a lens hood is recommended for protection and to shade the front element from glare. Speaking of hoods...HOOD NOT INCLUDED: The recommended EW-83E hood is bulky and (looks like a dish) and costs $32. Worse of all, it's so shallow it offers little protection. I have an EW-83H that came with an EF 24-105 4L IS USM. The bayonet mount is the same size as the EW-83E but the hood is longer and narrower, offering increased protection. I thought the longer length might vignette but, amazingly, it doesn't vignette at any focal length, has better protection from glare and less bulk than the EW-83E. If you're going to spend money on an expensive hood for the 10-22 3.5-4.5, get the EW-83H instead of the EW-83E. If you're on tight budget, check out the Vello EW-83H clone/knockoff.LAST BLURB: This zoom is a specially lens and a bit wide for casual use. After all, 10mm covers 107 degrees! Nevertheless, I reach for this lens to shoot cityscapes, landscapes or in tight quarters. It has ideal coverage for spacious cathedrals or mammoth train stations. If you need an ultra wide zoom on APS-C, this is among the best in terms of image quality: sharp, fast to focus and easy on the shoulder.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Impressive IQ for a wide zoom", "unixReviewTime": 1367107200, "reviewTime": "04 28, 2013"}

I decided then and there that when I got a DSLR I was going to fix that issue.Fast forward a few years and I got a Canon 60D for Christmas. In preparation for a trip to Greece (picture added to sample images) I hummed and hawed about getting the 10-22 because I was worried, even on a crop-sensor, that it would be TOO wide.I was debating spending the $700 on this 10-22 lens or spending $1500 on theCanon EF 16-35mm f/2.8L II USM Ultra Wide Angle Zoom Lenslens. A friend had picked up the 16-35 and said it was excellent; a perfect walk-around lens and that he never had an issue with it \"not being wide enough\".Anyway, due to cost I decided to get the 10-22 and have to say that was the BEST decision I made for the Greece trip. There are an innumerable number of shots (1300 in total) that I took on that trip, capturing hillside towns, the Parthenon or ancient ruins that would have been impossible with anything narrower.At 10mm on a crop-sensor like the 60D, that gives me an effective 16mm focal point and time and time again I was *so happy* the lens would go that wide when shooting inside a church or ruined building.The slight bending of perspective at really wide angles was a *good* thing I though; I don't mind it, I think it's artistic and helps give a \"woooAAAA that is big\" impression to friends and family viewing our pictures and trying to understand just how huge these ruins were.Since getting back I actually ended up buying the Canon 16-35 f/2.8L II USM after all and have to say that it is \"wide enough\" for most every day use, but for Greece, I would take the 10-22 again over the 16-35 any day because those extra 6mm make a big difference.If you are like me and trying to shoot huge things and capture them all in-frame, get the 10-22 and know you have an awesome lens.

My control over exposure time and the depth of field is minimal at this aperture.  Image Stabilizer works only at around 1/40 seconds or less.  During longer exposure times, pictures still show camera shake.Third, Canon, on it's website doesn't give MTF charts for this lens.  It's available for all other lenses including their cheap consumer zooms.  May be they figured this wasn't worth $600 and didn't want to publicize it.Bottomline: If you are point-and-shoot photographer that has a DSLR for kicks, then go ahead and get this lens.  It's one all-purpose lens for a 350D or a 20D.  But if you are serious about photography, avoid it.  I later bought a Tamron 28-75mm f/2.8 XR Di and a Tamron 17-35mm f2.8-4 XR Di.  Together it costed $800.  For the quality of their optics and the f2.8 constant max aperture, I happily gave up IS and USM. To top it, Tamron gave an $80 mail-in rebate and a standard 6 year warranty.I returned the lens to Amazon for a full refund, and I haven't had a more pleasant experience than their return process.  In the last 5 years that I've done business with Amazon, this was my first return.

Numbers are facts. If there is measurable falloff in the corners or low numerical resolution at a particular part of the zoom range such reviews will show it. People's opinions can have merit too - but first you kind of need a review of the reviewer. Do they know their stuff? Are their needs and expectations similar to your own? Have they used it enough to really know the Len's strengths and weaknesses?The final one -- using it yourself is in the end the best. This because numbers say little about pictures. No, really, they don't.  Doubt that? Then look at the great photos taken when even the best lenses lacked the basic qualities demanded of the least expensive SLR lenses today.  Do you say \"gee, great pic but the lens sucks\"?  No.  And some people who write a review have special needs that will have little impact on YOU.  An architectural photographer for instance.  Even a little curvature in a straight line will drive him crazy. But on your vacation photos of the mountains or the beaches you won't even notice that flaw.Fall off (\"vignetting\") can be a big deal if its bad. But most falloff from a modern DSLR lenses can be corrected almost 100% with basic software. (And the same is true for linear distortion btw.)So the best way to check out a lens is to use it yourself.All of these points came to me (again) when I purchased this EF-S 17 -85mm lens. Measurable fall off? At some zoom settings its got gobs. Distortion?  At wide setting ditto. Resolution?  Good to middling.

I've earned a good living as a photographer for over 40 years. My work has graced hundreds of articles, books, and more recently, web sites. And my \"art\" images have been displayed in a 'one man show' in an art-conscious community.OK then, what does my use tell me about this lens?Pluses:1) It has a really useful zoom range that encompasses a wide range of shots.2) It is light and relatively compact.3) Its resolution may not look great when presented in numbers, but it does look great in the photos I've taken with it.4) When quick processed with appropriate editing software (I use Lightroom) the falloff and linear distortion is approximately zero.5) Being discontinued and replaced by a measurably better but MUCH more expensive lens in Canon's catalog one can be be gotten for a song and maybe, with some luck, just a half stanza.

A Steal! Go for it!Regarding the negatives: It is a daily use lens that for many photographers will see 3 or 4 (or more) time on their camera than a more extreme type of lens.

However, the problem was partly solved by rotating the camera upside down - the zoom then worked perfectly and, so long as I did not run it all the way back to 17mm it was fine.  Just as suddenly, that problem disappeared for six months. Then it came back temporarily - not as bad but it was a problem and I could not use the lens freely.  But - once again it disappeared and I thought all was well.  Three weeks ago the lens locked up and it didn't matter what I did - it would not unlock.  I went to a couple of forum sites and found others had the same problem with the lens.  The end result?

Maximum Aperture of only f/4-5.6: this severely limits the DOF aspect of the lens and also generates the side effect of forcing longer shutter speeds, although the slower shutter speed can be partially remedied by the IS option on the lens the DOF limitation can not be avoided.  Not able to open up the aperture will limit creativity possibilities with this lens.2.

On the wide end of the zoom, which I personally use more often than the telephoto end, this lens is not very sharp, and it suffers from fairly bad distortion.  Worse than that, for me, are the chromatic abberations; this lens is quite prone to significant CA when shot at the wide end, which can look a lot worse than a little bit of distortion or softness.  Given the price of this lens, one should expect a higher level of optical performance.The maximum aperture of this lens is not very large, being f/4 on the wide end, and f/5.6 on the telephoto end.  The image stabilization makes up for this some, as you can comfortably shoot at much slower shutter speeds than otherwise, but, let's be honest here; this lens is a poor performer if you want to shoot in low light with no tripod.  The small aperture makes for a dark viewfinder, which can be a very big problem if you are trying to compose a picture in the dark (using a tripod).Yet, I still gave this very imperfect lens four stars, and this is not without reason.First of all, the focal length range is quite handy.  It isn't a mega-zoom that does everything, however, it covers the most often used focal length ranges, and is an appropriate lens to use for the vast majority of situations.  The little bit of extra zoom on the telephoto end is handy on occasion, and it's also worth noting that the lens sharpens up quite a bit when you zoom in some - it might be soft on the wide end, but zoomed in, it's quite good.I have printed as large as 20x30\" using this lens on a Digital Rebel, and have no qualms with the results.  Yes, there are sharper lenses out there, but you are a lot more likely to see the difference in sharpness on your computer monitor than in a print.This lens has ring USM, which enables it to focus very quietly, and very quickly, whereas the slightly cheaper (and F2.8) options from the 3rd parties have normal focusing motors that are slow and noisy by comparison.If you want to use this lens indoors, you are best off getting a flash to go with it, such as a 430EX.  The lens is usable in fantastic indoor lighting, or during the day, but won't give you good results in low light with no flash.If you will be shooting in lower light situations (people in particular), Tamron and Sigma have some good options in the 17-50mm range with F2.8 apertures, and I would recommend those lenses over this one.  If you'd prefer the extra telephoto range, the image stabilization so you can shoot with smaller aperture in poorer lighting situations for greater depth of field (instead of needing to shoot a landscape at f/4, for instance, without image stabilization, you could use f/11 on this lens, and get a sharp picture with better depth of field.  This is even more useful in the close focus range - while this isn't a true macro lens, if you take closeup photos without a tripod, you will want to stop the lens down for greater depth of field, and the IS helps with that quite a bit.Overall, I've been fairly pleased with the performance of this lens.  If you like to worry about splitting hairs, and zooming all the way in on pictures on your computer, this lens is likely to dissapoint you.  If, however, you are willing to sacrifice optical perfection to get a very well rounded, useful lens, then I'd recommend it, however, would also recommend that you consider the 3rd party options, as they are also great lenses, and do offer a somewhat better value.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good, but not great, all around lens.", "unixReviewTime": 1159315200, "reviewTime": "09 27, 2006"}

A fitting start to a device that will continue to impress you throughout its life.I have used my Garmin c330 StreetPilot for about a month now and I have found a few restaurants that aren't listed in its database and a few streets that don't run on the built-in maps like they do in real life. Chalk some of that up to construction, I guess. But for the most part, the road test in my home city in West Texas is expertly outlined with very few flaws. That means when I tell it to find the fastest way to the mall, it will. When I type in the address of my friend's house it will guide me right to the door and even tell me which side of the street it will be on. Wow!On a recent road trip I took this baby along for the almost 1,000 miles traveled in a weekend. When we were craving food, it would tell us which restaurants to expect in the upcoming towns. It even provides estimated times of arrival which were always accurate withing 30 minutes on trips that took six or seven hours.WHO IT'S FORI would highly recommend this device for anyone who is driving around a lot in a city they're not quite familiar with or someone who travels to unknown areas at least once every two months. It will save your road trip several times.It's for anyone who (like me) has ever turned the completely wrong way out of parking lot on the way home in a city I've lived in for years. If your sense of direction needs a supplement, buy this device.However, if you live in the same small town you've been in for years and don't travel at least bi-monthly, you don't need this. Maps would be a cheaper (but not always easier) way for you.PROS:- Detailed mapping, impressive route recalculation- Very easy to use (if you can use a digital wristwatch, you can use this product)- Customizable for more hardcore users- (This is cool!) Automatically switches to \"night mode\" after sunset -- it knows when sunset is for wherever you are. This makes it easier to see the information in the dark.- Has a very accurate database of food, fuel, hotels and many more points of interest -- very useful for going to small towns where you don't want to drive around for hours.- Changeable languages. You can change the voice directions to French, Norweigen or several others. It even has a woman with an American English voice and a different one with a British English voice. The British woman is much less annoying and much more soothing.CONS:- Tells you of upcoming turns three or four times (can be annoying at times, but the volume is adjustable)SUMMARY:Buy this device -- you will not be disappointed. When a friend or co-worker rides somewhere with you and sees it, they will be very jealous. A personal anecdote, my dad advised me not to buy this product. He quickly went back on that opinion when he rode around with me.

I personally find, \"shorter distance\" to be better in local area, but when you are traveling a little far, \"shorter time\" is better. But because, to change the setting, we have to go through, Settings->Navigation->Shorter Time, it becomes a hassle especially when you are driving.Overall, I think its a great product.

While the TomTom was a lot easier to use and great, it was limited by out-of-date maps (roads, bridges and exits 5 years old were not in the database).  When it worked it worked great.When Garmin introduced the c330, it was stikingly familiar to the TomTom product.  In using it extensively in the last few weeks, I have concluded that it is superior.  It is just as easy to use.  And I love the trip information screen that is lacking in the TomTom.  The maps are great.The TomTom does have a number of features that are missing in the c330.  You can set your present location with one touch as a favorite.  You get your next turn displayed on the screen at all times (which is lacking on the c330, though you can touch the screen and see and hear it).  You can do a detour with various options and then if not acceptable return to your original route.The c330 is smaller than the TomTom.  It is also easier to attach to the windshield mount than the TomTom.  The windshild mount itself is easy to attach and remove from the windshield, unlike the TomTom.  The display was not overly affected by direct sunlight, and can be set automatically to adjust to night time driving mode.  Though I like the dc cable being part of the mount, I would have preferred one that was not permanenty attached to the mount so I could use it without the windshield mount.  Though for short trips the battery life is more than adequate.Though I have not used Garmin's customer service to compare, I found TomTom support slow and not responsive in answering what I had asked.I also recommend buying the Covertec screen protector that they make for the TomTom Go.

Easy to use, very small, internal battery, and preloaded maps. A monkey can use this out of the box. Be very wary of some of the reviews on Amazon regarding GPS. Many may be by people who have a vested interest either because they work for a competitor or because they invested in or shorted the stock of the companies making these units. GPS navigation is really starting to catch on in this country and the economic stakes for the companies involved are large. These are multibillion dollar companies trying to compete in a market that is just starting, the market for portable navigation devices.Garmin makes the very best consumer GPS units in the world. They are the only GPS company that makes FAA certified integrated instrument pannels for airplanes. Do you really think they are putting out products that don't work? Garmin also has the best support I've ever experienced from any tech firm. I also own a Garmin PDA which broke and they replaced it for free outside of warrenty.This is the GPS unit that will bring GPS to the masses.  This is the first product that is easy enough for everyone to learn to use within 5 minutes.  The C series does not have all of the functions and features of the 26xx series, it doesn't show individual sat. data or lat or long, route sorting, but most of these features add little value and make the OS interface more complicated.  This is a pure GPS auto navigation unit.  For more tech savy buyers the 2600 series or iQue is a better choice.Compared to the Magellan Roadmate series, there is no comparision.  The Garmin unit is less expensive and better on every dimension.  Much smaller and lighter but with the same size screen as the 700.  Touch screen and internal battery.  Much better mounting system.  It really works well.  And a much larger POI database 5 million versus 2 million I think.  Most importantly, the Garmin is MUCH easier to use.  No one who tested both would buy the Magellan, unless they were French.The unit is so small and light it really is a marvel of engineering.  For the average Joe or Jane, this is the perfect GPS.Garmin is a great company and supports its products very well.  They provide free updates of the firmware for all their products and their customer service is first rate.  You won't be sorry if you buy this one.People who complain about the outdated maps should realize that there is a 1 or 2 year lag in adding new streets and POIs and no GPS has fully updated maps.  If you live in an area with a lot of new construction, this can be very frustrating.  Garmin provides map updates every two years or so (they are on version 6 now) for $75.  It is a lot easier and less expensive to update a Garmin handheld than a built in car nav system.  Some of Garmin competitors use maps by a different company that are very poor in comparision.  Garmin uses the best mapping data available from navteq and develops its almost 6 million POI database themselves.If you have any question about the C330, check one out in person at your local electronics shop.  You won't believe the size and ease of use.

For the features I was looking for, I narrowed my options to The Garmin 2620, Garmin C330, and Megellan 700. Needless to say the C330 was my pick.I painstakingly reviewed these (3) GPS items and read every review and feedback I could find, then I comb the manufacturers websites for all specs and features,updates yaddy yadda, then I made a few trips to the store to get some hands on experience and feel of the products.The C330 has a refreshing out of box experience. It can be fired up right away to begin use. I did not need to read the manual to start using it, the idiot proof interface makes it very easy to learn, which is a plus because my wife can use it when I'm doing the driving. The models that I also considered provided a little more features than the C330, But they did not have an internal power source. Memory-wise, the C330 has a 2 GIG micro drive, which is quite adequate for all the US maps and any updates etc.Personally, my heart was set on the Magellan 700, but the cost and the fact that it only had 2 million POI (Points of Interest) compared to Garmin 5 million POI, turned me away from it. Of the (3) items I considered, the C330 is the only one that has a 100% touch screen interface and the smallest size so that it can be mounted/stored anywhere. GPSs' are not getting any bigger, with today's designers using micro/flash memory technology, our units will become more inconspicuous.The C330 can be a little difficult to see in the Sunlight, but not too bad. The Megellan 700 and the Garmin 2620 does have a port for an external antenna as well as the C330, which can be had for about $20 from a third party source.The manual is very easy to read and colorful, but I found that it was not in-depth, some things I had to call Garmin to clarify. I was curious about the internal battery, that only they can change. It would cost $125 just to send the unit in if it needed work outside of the warranty period.....hopefully the battery will last about five years when I'm ready to upgrade.Garmin updated maps usually comes out every 10-14 months so one is due out any time now. and it would cost me $75 to update the maps if I so desire. If you plan to get one and you get it on or after the new maps release date, the upgrade would be free.I'm very please with the touch screen response and the layout out the maps, the list of Hotels, restaurants etc. all w/ phone numbers too. the volume is great, as long as you're not do 80MPH w/ your windows down. It recognizes dirt roads also - provided that the roads all existed before 2004 (the last map release date).I will not be redundant and mention all the other points that the previous reviews mention, but for the most part the (3-4) reviews before mine were accurate and very helpful.The C330 does not display your elevation, which is a minus, it's nice to know when driving in the mountains.This unit has its share of nuggets to find that will just leave you in amazement. If I had to choose all over again I'll still get the C330.Buyers beware, If you purchase the more expensive model (c330) it comes preloaded with all the maps so there is no need to be transferring data back and forth, but you DO NOT get the software on City Select CD ROM. If you opt for the cheaper version (C320) you will get the City Select CD, because the entire map can't fit on that unit..you'll have to transfer data via memory card.I've also noticed that unless you are looking directly perpendicular to the screen, the colors don't show correctly, in other words if you are the driver or passenger and you look at the screen at an angle, it will be still visible but the colors tend to wash out, sort of like with a laptop if the screen is not tilted right.My experience with Tech support is fair. The wait time is a little lengthy, but once one the phone, they don't try to rush you through your questions to get you off the phone. I was helped adequately with all my questions.A great advantage is the mounting flexibility, any area of the windshield, the dashboard or console (comes w/base mount) or as a handheld providing the internal battery doesn't quit. Icons, splash screens and markers can by customerized via the Garmin software on their website. the images can be transported back and forth from the unit as BMP files and edited.There are three ways to view the map1) Bird's eye view with the map always facing north and the arrow/cursor moves as you drive.2) Bird's eye view with the arrow remains still and the map moves around as you drive3) \"3D\" mode. Where the view is the same as you would see out of your windshield except it's slightly elevated so you can see a wider angle and detect streets about a block away an all three sides of you.The unit automatically detects your speed and zooms out when you're driving fast and zooms in when you're moving slow, so you're never over/under driving the map. The receiver is very good in my opinion, sometimes (depend on what part of the house I am) I get a good signal indoors. I have my C330 mounted above my rearview mirror in my vehicle (barely got it to fit) so it does NOT have a clear view of the sky and if it did, the factory tint in the windshield would also block it...yet I get a good signal. Mounting it on the middle of my windshield yield the best results and start up time, but I chose to mount it above my rearview mirror to eliminate any sunlight glare from hitting the screen and it's working great.To respond to previous reviewers comments.... It was pointed out that Garmin should've added a feature where you can see an Icon or marker that indicated the locations of all the POI nearby as you drive by them. Well I've found a way to do it, although it's not noted in Garmin's sub-par manual. All you have to do is go to [Menu - Where To - Show Map] and you'll see all the attractions, lodging, eating, gas etc. locations on the road/area that you're currently on.Another thing that's not mentioned on the manual. Lets say you're somewhere and you don't know the address, but you want to save and revisit that location.

You can read the 2xx other reviews for that. I will tell this much: c330 is a great unit for one heck of a price (299 shipped!!!). You really just take it out of the box and it's ready to go. First off, I've never owned any GPS equipment. So even though higher models like the c340 speaks the street names, or the nuvi 350 is no bigger than a deck of cards, the c330 has everthing a gps newb needs to get around town, or across the country. US and Canda are already loaded. I really wanted the Nuvi 350 but it was out of my price range. I was considering the c320 to save more money, but with the $20 price difference (on Amazon) it was only logical to get the c330. It's got most major restaurants, gas stations, attractions and a bunch of other categorized POI's that I'll probably never need, but just nice to know they exist if I need them...or if I'm bored and just want to see what other POI this thing has. As far as the voice nav goes she usually tells me to turn when it's at .1 mile. I think the \"turn\" prompts can be a bit sooner, but as long as you're aware you will be fine.  Now it would be nice if it said the actual street name, but all it takes is a quick glance to see which street she's talking about and you're on track.The text on the screen is clear and readable. I have mine mounted near the bottom of my windshield. Btw, that mount has very good suction. I don't know what people are talking about when they say the mount doesn't hold. Here's what some people might overlook on the mount: It's got a lever that is in the \"locked\" position when you get it. So what you've got to do is flip up the lever to \"unlocked\". Stick it to the windshield and flip the lever down to \"locked\" and that thing will be on there nice and tight! To take it off, just work it in reverse and off it will come.There are a few things I noticed. Almost all routes chosen where the ones my fiance would choose (she's the Baltimore local not me). I have mine set to Fastest Route , but some destinations have me take a turn too early or go around. Case in point, I went to Costco today and was told it was right if off the highway, but the c330 told me to go right basically making one big circle. It was just a couple minutes extra so no big deal. Now if I was by myself I wouldn't have even noticed b/c I was not at all familiar with the area. So yes, there is the chance that it won't pick the most ideal route, but then again that Garmin route won't have you too far off from the route that a person familiar with the area would chose.I haven't tested the SD slot, but I've read that it's pretty useless for loading custom POIs until you step up to the c530 models and higher. The SD slot does read maps for other countries so all hope is not lost if and when you plan to travel to areas outside the U.S. In order to load custom POIs you'd need to take the c330 in with you and use the USB to plug it directly to your computer. You'd basically load it directly onto the c330's internal memory. Garmin says its got 2mb of internal memory, though they didnt specify how much of that is actually used by the unit. So up to this point I don't know how much usuable internal memory there is. I don't plan to load tons and tons of POI so its doesn't seem to be an issue with me. What I've done in the few days I've used it is to look up where I want to go (on the internet) and get the address or just look it up on the c330. I've saved locations that I frequent in the Favorites section so they'll be there when I need them.Another thing I want to mention is the size. Don't expect to fit this in your jeans pocket and not have people notice ;). Yes, it is small, but not Nuvi 350 small. But to get Nuvi 350 small you need to cough up about $150 more. May not seem like much more, but for those on a budget I think you can overcome the size issue. I usually keep mine in my jacket pocket where there's more space. I don't even notice it's there. I also carry a side bag, but I won't be putting it there until I get a case for it.I haven't had the chance to use it in direct sunlight. People say the glare is killer, but I'm sure it's not anything that an antiglare screen can't fix. Amazon sells those too. They're from Boxwave if you're curious.So there it is. Just a few minor setbacks that can easily be overlooked or overcome with a few adjustments. It doesn't have all the fancy features like an mp3 player or bluetooth, but if you just want to know how to get somewhere with confidence and at the same time have some really useful functions with a well known brand you cant go wrong with the c330...btw, did I mention it's only $299 :)", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Not all the bells and whistles, but still great...and who needs bells and whistles anyway???", "unixReviewTime": 1165363200, "reviewTime": "12 6, 2006"}

First of all, I was able to use this gadget out of the box with minutes of walking out with it from the store. I paid for it, got in the car, ripped it out of the box and turned it on. I didnt even open the manual. This was the very first time that I ever tried using a GPS unit, yet I was able to turn it on and head straight home using the voice instructions.  It has no visible buttons except for the power on switch and the volume dial on the side. Large letters and large screen. Clarity of picture was excellent and this was at 12 high noon. The sun was directly above me so the car had ample shade for the screen anyway. Fast forward to now. Three weeks later, I used this thing on a trip to New Jersey which is about 300 miles from home. Auto rerouting was almost instantaneous, though I did lose satellite reception a couple of times while roaming in downtown streets. Very user friendly, you can search for nearby points of interests, gas, food, lodging, etc and the touch screen menu was very easy to use. I still haven't opened the manual!  It does have some problems distinguishing left versus right . Once I was arriving at a state park and it did bring me all the way there, but it said it was on my right side when actually the park was on my left! For a complete gps novice like myself, this unit has proven it self to be very very easy to use and packed with so many details. Fully loaded, you don't need to download the US as it is already downloaded for you. Battery backup is very handy as you can use it as a handheld device for hiking although it is shaped somewhat funny/boxy for that purpose plus it is not waterproof.  It saves your favorite searches too. You can choose between 2d or 3d view. It attaches to your front window via a suction cup mechanism.

It's trying to be too many things to too many levels of photographer.  Canon is clearly going for the consumer/semi-professional/professional market.  In my opinion it turns a potentially great camera into an expensive gadget.  Too many features, too many menu options, too many automatic modes--in short, too much of everything.  Imagine buying a car that has manual AND automatic transmission and is a combination hard-top/rag-top convertible with disc and drum brakes front and back, an AM/FM radio, CD player, cassette player, 8-track tape player, reel-to-reel player, record player, and a 16-track digital recording studio.  \"Cool!\" you say?

It makes it a pain in the arse to use--unless you want those features, of course.  I don't.2). You can't use the display as a viewfinder.  This is a huge deal-killer, in my opinion.  One of the great advantages of a digital camera is the ability to use the onscreen display for setting up your shots.  I understand they're trying to maximize battery life, but a digital camera where you CAN NOT use the display while you're shooting is absurd.3). Terrible macro mode.  Not just average.  Terrible.  You definitely need an optional macro lens in order to take decent macro photos with this camera.  Otherwise, you're going to be stuck with Canon's bizarre decision to force the use of flash in macro mode (you get to choose between no flash mode or macro mode in the auto settings (but not both(?)) or manual mode with an optional lens).  Buying a closeup lens for a high-end camera is reasonable to expect, I suppose, except that I've never run into this problem with ANY other digital camera I've used.  Most are great for quick-and-dirty macro photography right out of the box.4). The dumbest manual white-balance procedure I've ever seen in my life.  Use it.  I dare you.5). Incredibly lousy manual.  Standard feature for ALL cameras these days, I know.  Doesn't excuse the fact, however.Don't get me wrong, this is a GREAT camera that takes excellent pictures and works as advertised.

The weight of autofocus lenses (at least my USM 28-105 3.5) makes for a challenging hold to maintain a rock-steady posture to take crisply sharp photos, especially at higher magnifications. I'm inclined to trade it in for an IS lense (yes, it is an additional $200+), but may be a virtual necessity. The extra cost in going SLR to me isn't worth comprising what your objective is in going from darn good point and shoot resolution (at least from my Olympus 4000)to the quality one expects from this upgrade. This rating doesn't reflect on the camera, just the photos taken without IS (yes, it is subjective).

I researched all the consumer dSLRs and decided on the XT Rebel 350 because of it's size and 8MP CCD, plus, I'd had two Canon point and shoot digitals that were fantastic.I've been taking pictures on a semi-professtional level for thirty years and I attended Brooks Institute of Photography, so I sort of know what I'm doing.Bought the Rebel XT at a local store in San Francisco, along with the Canon 28-200 Zoom. Immediately went up to Chinatown to shoot pictures of the Festival of the Harvest Moon with my wife, who was using her Nikon D70 with the Nikon 28-200.Shot pictures all day, and absolutely loved the way the XT handled. It was very intuitive, fast, had a bright viewfinder -- I couldn't have been happier.Then, we got home and looked at the pictures. I'd shot mostly on automatic, or shutter priority all day, with shutter speeds above 250th of a second.Bottom line, my wife's pictures were crystal clear, popped really, and mine of the same or similar subjects were just a tad fuzzy. You couldn't tell at 5x7 or so, but when you brought it up to 8x10  or above the difference was obvious. I checked the historgram on the shots, and they were made at nearly the same settings. Couldn't be, right? After all, the Nikon is only 6 MP, the Canon 8MP.So I put both cameras on a tripod, pointed them at a brick wall with a sign about 100 feet away, set everything the same on the cameras, and low and behold, same fuzziness.I took the Canon back the next day and traded it in on a D70. Now, maybe I got a bad lense, or a camera where the auto-focus was tweaked, but I couldn't afford the time to test it out again and again. I knew the Nikon would work, and it did (and does).Since then, I've talked to friends, professionals, who say that the XT is known to have auto-focus \"issues\".  This seems to be inconsistent, with some reviewers being delighted by the camera, others having a little problem.As I said above, the camera handles really well, intuitively, and  I actually like the compact size (some SLR users like a heavier camera). I may have gotten a lemon, but if you are going to need to depend on getting sharp pictures and can't go back for reshoots, I'd step up to the Canon D20 or go with a Nikon dSLR.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Handles Great, Autofocus just not there", "unixReviewTime": 1137542400, "reviewTime": "01 18, 2006"}

I've transitioned from using point and shoot cameras to the SLR.  I just can't believe the difference.  The quality of the photos is truly amazing.I was actually debating between the Nikon D70 and the XT.  I had been preferring the D70 b/c of the \"better\" kit lens.  But I actually went to Best Buy and took pictures with both cameras, side by side, at different settings including full auto.  I then printed out prints to compare the two.  The XT was ablt to pick up small shows and detail in the back of the store that the D70 just showed as a blur.  All different settings looked better with the XT.  The pictures were much, much clearer and crisper and the color was much more like actual colors in the store.  Also, the D70 wasn't as easy to use as the XT.  The menus were not as clear as the XT.  Needless to say, I stopped looking into the D70.Now, over 7500 photos later, I'm totally happy with my choice.  I have actually zoomed in on portraits using my desktop and was able to see the tear ducts in my daughter's eyes.  The camera is also simple enough for my wife to take great photos.Pros: 3 pics per second - super fast.  Great price for a dig SLR. Easy to use menus.  Great indoor photos.

The new DR XT is quite different.  Even though it's 3 ounces lighter than the original DR -- mostly due to the use of a smaller battery; see below -- its smaller form factor actually makes it feel more solid and \"real\".  In other word, unlike the original DR, this one feels professional, not toy-like at all.By now you probably already know Canon makes some of the best digital cameras in the world.  Even though I'm a Nikon shooter when it comes to d-SLR (sorry, loyal Canon shooters!), I own a couple Canon compact digital cameras and love them, too.  The DR XT's image quality is once again excellent.  I took a few indoor shots with the camera, both with and without flash, and then the store clerk let me download them to their PC.  The JPEG pictures (I didn't try RAW) looked excellent on the Sony LCD screen, on par with the more expensive EOS 20D d-SLR.  Color tones were accurate and the resolution was really good.  The improvement picture quality over the original DR (\"DR Classic\"? BTW it's now $200 cheaper) comes from both the 2 extra megapixels and the better color accuracy.  BTW, the DR XT reportedly uses a tecchnically different CMOS sensor than the original DR, although I haven't been able to find out exactly how this one is better in technical terms than the old one (other than the two extra megapixels).  No matter, my limited true-world testing showed the image quality is indeed better than the already-excellent image quality of the original DR.  And, as in the past, Canon does a wonderful job at keeping noise low -- I considered noise acceptable up until ISO 800.The kit, which I recommend, comes with the same flimsy 3x EF-S lens (which won't work on regular film SLRs) as the original DR.  You should most definitely get a better lens, although the kit lens works well as a \"street zoom.\"  I didn't get a chance to test the lens outdoors as the store wouldn't let me take it outside, but I have no doubt that this new model can only be better than the original DR, which was already very good even before you considered its low price.The DR XT is fast: at last, you can turn it on and start shooting without waiting several seconds like you had to with the original DR.  The only downside compared to the original DR is the smaller, lighter battery in the DR XT also means shorter battery life.  I highly recommend you get an extra battery or two.  You won't be able to go through a full day of shooting on just one battery, even if you don't use flash much.  (But all pros and pro-wannabes use fill-in flash, don't we?)  I also recommend a good camera bag; I personally like Tamrac for that.  In addition to the spare battery (batteries), bag and a better lens or two, also consider getting a tripod (Sunpak ones are cheap but ok quality), an external flash as well as filters -- esp. a high-qual circular polarizing filter.In summary, the Canon Digital Rebel XT is another stunning winner from Canon.  It features faster speeds (start-up and shot-to-shot), excellent image quality, and terrific look-and-feel.  Despite my personal preference for Nikon pro-level gear, I can recommend this Canon d-SLR to my friends without reservation.Feel free to e-mail me at gadgester @t hotmail with your questions and commends.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Another stunning winner from the bright minds at Canon", "unixReviewTime": 1110844800, "reviewTime": "03 15, 2005"}

I have also owned a 1 MP Nikon (sold for upgrade), 2MP Nikon (dropped and broken) and 3MP Nikon (too plastic and pictures always needed color balancing in Photoshop). The Canon SD 400 takes it all in terms of everyday use --- due to the easy learn features and size. For the average user, this is a GREAT CAMERA and GREAT VALUE for the price. The SD 450 has a 2.5 LCD and is heavier...After reading many reviews of the Sony T-series and SD 400 at Amazon and [...], I decided on the Canon SD 400 camera as it had many more features than the Sony T-series and was a bit lighter. Both the Sony DSC-T1 and T33 were the same price as the Canon SD 400 and about two ounces heavier.I am more than delighted with the features of the Canon SD 400 and find the pictures great for such a small point and shoot.ProsThe Manual Mode setting will let you customize various settings for shooting vs. using the Automatic Mode settings.Stitching program in Manual Mode will assist you in stitching together a panaorama shot rather than software which is more difficult to match multiple images (get it right when you are there rather than trying to adjust images that are not going to look right stitched together because you stepped back or angled the shot by accident).Ability to choose from 2 autofocus settings. The AiAF setting which is the default will take longer to focus, so you can turn it off and use a single vs. multiple focus read.Continuous shots with little lag (as long as battery lasts and memory card has storage).Easy to learn controls (the manuals that came with this camera weighed 10 times more than the camera) and features.Viewfinder with LCD (most ultracompact cameras like the Sony T-series only have LCD screens and no viewfinder).2 inch LCD.Small Size (smaller than a deck of cards) --- carry it all of the timeRelatively long battery life.Easy to purchase extra batteries (non-Canon) that are reliable and safe for the camera on E-Bay.ConsViewfinder only shows 82% of the picture vs. the LCD (You won't see that extra tree that you will have to crop out later in Photoshop).Manual is difficult to read (more a reference than a read as the camera is easy to use).Not retaining exposure change adjustments and flash settings from various shooting modes.Color swap features are hard to learn without reading the manual.Get a 1GB secure digital camera and shoot 350+ pictures in the highest resolution (super fine) and size.

This is because they have always used high quality components since they began manufacturing digital cameras. This one is no exception.Now that I've sold you on a Canon, which one should you choose?First off, let's see if you really need an SDxxx camera, or would be better suited with a cheaper non ultraportable camera.The SDxxx Series offers several key advantages over less portable models:-Beautiful, sleek design and metallic body will wow anyone who sees it.-Gorgeous 2 inch LCD screens-The excellent Dig!c 2 processor (other Canons only have dig!c 1)-Much better movie mode than previous Canons-Small light, easy pocketabilityOn the other hand, there are some significant drawbacks due to the components Canon had to use to get the camera so small:-Few manual controls.-Pictures are not as sharp as those of similar non ultraportable cameras.-The flash is very close to the lens (lots of redeye problems)-More purple fringing issues than other Canons-Proprietary batteries that are expensive to replace-The LCD is very fragile.  Read the SD200 and SD300 reviews to see lots of unhappy people whose LCDs broke.  Canon's warranty does NOT cover this either.  My suggestion?  Buy using a credit card that offers a warranty in addition to the manufacturer's.  If your lcd breaks, many CC companies will replace the camera no questions asked!If you don't need the ultra portability and flashy looks of the SD cameras, a slightly larger camera with more features might be right for you.  I would highly suggest Canon's A510 or A520 if you don't need an SD model.If you still want an SD model, which one should you choose?  The SD200 with 3.2mp, the SD300 with 4mp, the SD400 with 5mp, or the SD500 at a whopping 7.1mp?Your first instinct may be that more megapixels is better.  Today, however megapixel ratings are similar to Ghz ratings in the computer world: They used to mean a lot, but they don't mean as much anymore. More megapixels do NOT mean a better image. They mean a larger printable image.  Unless you have to have huge prints, you simply do not more megapixels.  In fact, the 3.2mp of the SD200 is enough for anyone who doesn't plan on printing pictures larger than a standard 8.5x11 sheet of paper.That having been said, there are some differences between each SDxxx model.  In order to get the larger 7.1mp sensor in the SD500, Canon had to make the camera larger.  Thus, it is around a quarter inch thicker and 30% heavier than the other 3 models.  The larger size did enable Canon to pack more features into it, however:Features unique to the SD500:-1/4 inch thicker-30% heavier-50% longer flash range-14% more battery lifeThe SD400 and SD500 also share these benefits over the SD200/SD300:-New \"Night Display\" feature which brightens the LCD in low light-My Colors feature lets you highlight or swap colors right on the camera-USB 2.0 High Speed supportThe following are shared by all the SDxxx Cameras:Pros:-Beautiful, eye catching design-Great image quality, though not as good as non ultraportable models-New Dig!c 2 image processor-Excellent Movie Mode-3x optical zoom is adequate for most people-Excellent, intuitive manual controls-Huge 2.0 inch lcd that looks great under various lighting conditions-Uses widely available and cheap SD cardsCons (most of these are minor quirks):-Some purple fringing problems-Proprietary batteries are expensive to replace and inconvenient at times-Lots of issues with fragile LCDs-No RAW support-Few manual controlsIf you do choose this product, the first thing you should buy is a larger SD memory card.

Besides having 5 megapixels, the camera has one of the best movie modes in the business.  I have seen a lot of movie modes by Fuji, Sony, and others.  Canon has the best, hands down.  The reason is how they compress the movies.  Canon has the least compression (movies must be compressed from a large file to a smaller one to fit on the SD card.) The new Digic II processor assists the movie mode to a full 30 frames/sec.  Also a fast start up time of just over a second and uninterrupted 2.1 frame per second shooting.The only camera in the Canon line that has a better movie modeis the new S2IS camera.  This one also gives you stereo sound.  However, it is a much larger camera.  The thing that appeals to me about the SD400 is that you can carry it anywhere and it will be there to get the shot.  Either still picture or movies.There is a new trend of smaller cameras such as the SD400, the Sony T series, and Casio having much larger LCD screens.  These screens are 2\" or larger.  With a larger LCD, you must also take care of your camera better.  With the older cameras, the screen was small, and less likely to get damaged.  Here are some tips that should keep your SD400 from ever having a cracked screen, or for that matter any of the newer cameras from Sony, Casio, Fuji, etc. that have larger LCD screens.  (You can damage any LCD screen regardless of brand).[1] Do not place camera in with sharp objects like keys, lipstick holders, or any metal objects.  I would suggest this even if you have the camera in a thin case, as the thin case is still no protection from sharp objects that can exert a lot of pinpoint pressure.[2] If you carry it in your pocket, you should not do it in tight pants, and do not sit on the camera!  I recommend not carrying it in your pants pocket (too easy to bump into hard objects). I never have and never had a problem.  If you feel the need to carry it in your pants, carry it so the LCD is NOT on the outside and vulnerable. The older models were too thick to fit in your pocket. I think you are seeing a lot more people improperly carry this camera because of its thin size.[3] The best bet would be a well padded case (not a thin one).Padding is the key here. Pamper your new camera.[4] Do not drop camera.  Always put the strap around your arm when taking your camera out of the case. That way you never will drop it.  Any digital camera will have a high probability of damage if you drop it. These are delicate electronic devices and need to be treated as such.[5] Do not leave your camera in your car.  Extreme heat or extreme cold is very bad for any electronic device with an LCD screen.  The SD400 is no exception.There is a silent majority of SD400 owners out there that are enjoying the camera, but have not left reviews. I would like to hear from them.  Let people know of your success with the camera and you can even post images here that you have taken.  Respect the camera, and it will give you a long life.Update: Just went on a trip to Europe.  Two girls on the trip had the sd400 camera.  They did have cases for their cameras, but one did not even have a strap on their camera.  Both cameras survived the trip with no problems.  They even took the cameras to the beach, and up mountains, and on several boats.  They did not put the camera in unprotected pockets.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "SD400 - a Fantastic Digital Camera", "unixReviewTime": 1119657600, "reviewTime": "06 25, 2005"}

After several months with the SD400, I have concluded that it was a waste of money because I have yet to realize any true advantages over the S100, and there are even a few drawbacks!What's definitely better:* USB 2.0. Much faster downloads that before. Be sure you connect to a USB 2.0 port, though.* Movie mode. Nice if you want something besides a still.What's better, perhaps:* Higher resolution (5.0 megapixels vs 2.1). But except for enlargements, I am not finding much benefit to this, and naturally the file sizes are bigger. I know that I can shoot at lower resolution, but then what's the point?* Smaller (only half as thick). This is nice, but not compelling. It doesn't fit anywhere that the S100 wouldn't.* Much larger display. I like it, but I'm concerned about its fragility. The old S100 had a smaller display but could be treated roughly without worry.What's not improved:* In automatic mode, you STILL cannot choose to force the flash to be used; you still only have the choices of auto flash or no flash. Has Canon never heard of fill flash? You have to go to manual mode to select this feature, which I find annoying.What's worse:* Annoying and fragile plastic lid over the USB connector. This thing isn't going to last long.* And the thing that I REALLY don't like about the SD400: blurry pictures. A significant number of the pictures that I have taken have been blurry for one reason or another, but mostly due to camera's choice of too low of a shutter speed. If you select the option of \"no flash\" this problem is particularly likely. Supposedly there is a \"camera shake\" warning indicator to help prevent this, but good luck seeing it when you need it. At a minimum, Canon needs to provide an option to prevent pictures or force flash if it computes the need for a shutter speed that is below a reasonable hand-held limit, which I have always taken to be 1/60 sec.So even after purchasing the SD400, I'm still using my old S100 much of the time, mostly because it is much more rugged, and also because I have never had blurred picture with it.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Not an improvement over the original Digital ELPH", "unixReviewTime": 1124582400, "reviewTime": "08 21, 2005"}

I took this on a vacation to Africa, it shot very sharp wildlife photos and was unscathed sitting in my pocket for days on end, sometimes in high temperatures.  I have used its zoom quite a bit, and it takes very sharp pictures across its 3x optical, and very acceptable quality up to about 8x (combined digital and optical), but beyond 8x and up to the max 12x (3x optical * 4x digital), the quality is almost unusable.  So it wasn't the best for distance photography, but very acceptable.  There is minor purple fringing as with all point and shoots, but not at all noticeable on an any print 5x7 or less.

I can't tell you if this is better than some similar camera, since I haven't used any others.That said, I'm really liking this camera.Out of the box, it's very easy to figure out how to point-and-shoot and use basic functions with all possible adjustments set to the default \"automatic\" setting.  After that, you'll have to hit up the manual.  Due to the compact design, there's no room for a verbose menu system, so everything is icon-based.  To figure out how to access more advanced features, you're going to have to reference the manual.The manual is quite comprehensive, though, and handily indexed so I've been able to find what I wanted without much trouble.  The manual also does a reasonable job of explaining not just how to adjust the settings, but what the different settings mean, e.g., \"ISO 50\" vs \"ISO 400\".  It tells you how to change it and a brief explanation of why different settings may be desired.The picture resolution is quite spectacular.  In fact, if you're just looking to take casual pictures to send to family members over the internet or a camera to take standard-sized photos with, you could certainly get away with a cheaper camera.  This camera takes pictures of sufficient resolution to print as a small poster!  (Or a very large glossy print.)The video mode is quite nice as well.  With a 1 GB memory card, you can record over 15 minutes of video at maximum quality, or over 45 minutes of video at a medium quality (or over 2 hours of video at lowest quality).  The video also includes sound, though I have doubts as to the quality of the built in microphone.The built-in flash is great and it has a red-eye reducer.  The optical + digital zoom is fairly impressive and there other other features such as rapid-fire picture snapping (where you hold down the button as the camera clicks away) and macro mode (allowing you to take a magnified shot of something really close to the lens).Transferring data to your computer is also quite simple, with the included connections and software.  You can also, of course, review stored images using the camera itself and erase whatever you want from there.As the camera only comes with a very tiny memory card, I advise getting a bigger memory card and an extra battery when you buy this camera.  I got the 1 GB card and can honostly say it's more space than I could ever possibly want.  1 GB holds hundreds of top quality pictures -- or almost 2000 pictures at 1600x1200 resolution!There are cameras that take even higher resolution pictures than this one, but unless you know for a fact that you want to use your camera to print large posters, you truely don't need more than 5 megapixels.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Feature Rich and Easy to Use(*)", "unixReviewTime": 1128902400, "reviewTime": "10 10, 2005"}

I have always been interested in Canon products, especially the optics on their Digital and SLR cameras. The Canon Powershot SD400 Digital Elph has outperformed ALL of the previous cameras that I have owned. There are many cameras available with 5 megapixels or even more. It's important to pay attention to the quality of the camera in a number of different areas and NOT to just focus on the number of megapixels a camera has.I purchased this camera when it first came out-probably one of the first off the shelf. I should have waited for all of the rebate offers and sales, however I wanted to replace my previous ELPH and pass it on to a nephew so I could get the newest Canon Digital Camera. I had read all of the reviews online and in periodicals that I like to read. It was unanimously agreed upon that this camera really packed a true bang for the buck!I am a photographer and use typical SLR and Medium Format Cameras for the most professional work. I've incorporated digital photography for moments when I don't have the time to put the whole camera outfit together or when I am traveling and don't want to carry a heavy camera, lens, flash, etc. Recently I put the Canon to the test. I was called upon to photograph a Canadian Competition Bicycling team, from Toronto, that was training in sunny Arizona. The photo shoot went very well and I was comfortable that the photos would turn out great. In addition to taking my typical \"35mm Film\" photographs, I chose to use my Canon Powershot SD400 to see how it would compare.I developed all of the 35mm photographs and had prints made for all members of the racing team. After I finished this 4 day process, everything from taking the photos to developing the negatives and finally making prints of the best photos, I turned to my new ELPH and used my laptop computer to view the pictures. I was totally astounded by the incredible performance of this small but mighty camera. I decided to take it another step higher and took my Memory Card to a Kinko's Copy Center and had enlargements made-everything from 5 x 7's to 8 x 10's.The colors were brilliant and it was impossible for me to see any differences in quality between the original small prints and the 5 x 7's and 8 x 10's! As a semi-professional photographer, like so many others, I assumed that I would see a difference once the digital photos were enlarged. Not the case with this awesome digital Canon Powershot SD400 5MP Elph Camera!I hung 2 prints on the wall, both 8 x 10's from my 35mm SLR Camera, and then placed the digital 8 x 10's from Kinko's just below them. It would take a very, very professional eye, with a very, very powerful magnifier, to discern any differences in quality. I've always been impressed with the Canon Digital Cameras that I have owned, but this 5 megapixel Elph is a true gem and the best digital camera I have ever owned. I ended up with 4 photos on the wall, that still remain there, as I enjoy showing clients the power of a high quality digital camera.I hope this review offers some assistance to you. There are so many technicals points that I could have discussed with you, however I wanted to present an honest review as a result of a true experience I had with this incredible camera.

Using Windows Movie Maker you can create your own movies and email them in compressed format to your friends.

My most recent acquisition was a Pentax Optio SV which I panned in a review posted here on Amazon.Anyway, Canon is the benchmark for all other digital cameras. This model offers excellent, sturdy build (it was dropped onto a stone floor when it was only a few days old....even though it made a pretty bad sound, it wasn't dinged or scratched. I'm not sure how that can be, but it is a fact) and very good visual appeal. The size and weight are perfect. It is small enough for a purse or even a pocket, but not so small that it is hard to grasp while shooting.The LCD screen is the best I've used; 2 inches and readable even in bright sunlight. The optical viewfinder (I just don't like cameras that make you rely upon the LCD only for framing images; sometimes I feel I need to frame an image the old fashioned way) is tiny but very bright and also features all of the menu items you select from setup (or none if you prefer).The 3X optical zoom is smooth and fast and in most cases that's enough zoom power, though I did buy that Optio in search of even more power. For the record, pay no attention to digital zooms. They are computer trickery that enlarges the central part of your image at the expense of image resolution. For example, a 2X digital zoom effect exactly halves your resolution, making such images often unfit for printing. Talking about resolution and printing, the 5 megapixels available on this model allows for high quality 11\" x 14\" prints. The camera is also capable of functioning as a camcorder in a pinch, offering full motion (60 FPS) video and sound limited only by the size of your memory card.The controls of the SD400 are simple and intuitive and the menus have evolved nicely, making it much easier than it was with my S200 to navigate and adjust things. That said, the SD400 is part of a class of cameras designed mostly for automatic users; if you crave control, you're probably not shopping for this type of digicam.I find the Canon colors to be about the truest, though performance in that area is degraded when using the flash. Also, \"red eye\" is a problem, though newer software programs like Microsoft's PictureIt! Photo Premium 9 have finally made red eye fixes really easy.While I agree that the Canon's need for a proprietary battery is a pain, I am satisfied with the battery life--about 140 shots with the LCD on and the flash not in use--and I like the very compact charger included with the camera. To be on the safe side, I ordered another battery here on Amazon (a generic that is not too expensive and works identically to the branded one that came in the box).Of course the included 32 meg SD memory card is too small to be useful, but that is the case with every single digital camera I've bought. No matter, these cards are reasonably priced (though not quite as cheap as the larger CompactFlash format) and now come in gargantuan sizes if you like. I paid about $50 for a 512 MB Ultra II card that will hold hundreds of images.Lastly, I want to commend the new Digic II processor in the SD400. It is ready to shoot in about one second after it is powered up, and there is almost no shutter lag at all. Recovery time for a second shot is similarly brief.

When it comes to ultra-wides, I've had my share. From the Tokina 11-16/2.8 (sold cause the range was too limited), two copies (one Nikon, one Canon) of the Tokina 12-24/4 and the Tokina 10-17 fisheye, I've tried most of them out there. (Sorry, I'll not spend a dime on a EF-S lens again. Thus, I've never had the cheapo Canon 10-22)This is my replacement to the motorless Nikon-mount Tokina 12-24/4 (version 1 - version 2 has an internal focus motor). I was very skeptical of this lens for a number of reasons. Sigma has had troubles lately, I'm not a fan of variable aperture lenses and it's a \"third party\" lens. I've owned lots of them, but I usually end up being happier with Canon or Nikon lenses. As this does replace one of the top-rated (and personal fav of mine) 12-24, it has a lot to live up to. It doesn't disappoint.Honestly, you're spending about half (or less) than any Nikon branded lens in the range (and right now - that would be one: 10-24). So expecting perfection or even close is certainly a path to unhappiness. I expected to send it back - but I haven't.Pros: 10mm on the short end. Fixable distortion. Reasonable CA. You get good colors and contrast. Fast focus, given the focal length.Cons: CA, soft at the edges.Really, for the money and for the way that most of us print, you'll find little, if any, difference between this and any other UWA. Nope, it doesn't have a fixed 2.8 - so if isolating your subject is important - pick the Tokina 11-16. Although I'm not sure that's the focus of this type of lens, anyway.Anyone who will be really unhappy with this lens will fall into two camps: pixel-peepers and pros. Pros, most likely, won't be shooting DX anyway. Pixel-peepers are seldom, if ever, really happy. Everyone else is going to find what most reviewers say, it's a great lens.

At 10-20mm, the range is almost too wide, but after further usage, I got used to it. I'm very accustomed to a 12-24mm range and the 10-20mm took a lot of getting used to. The only drawbacks I know of in using this lens is that it is really prone to flare (despite the marketing by Sigma stating that the new lens coating diminishes flare) and the biggest aperture is f/4 which is variable pending on the focal length. It is not a fixed aperture lens. I also find that this lens is at it's sharpest around f/8-f/11 and I wouldn't go beyond that because I started noticing the degrading of image quality at very small apertures with this lens.

Two months later, I couldn't be happier. It shoots where no other lens could shoot. Everyone knows that \"10mm is wide\", but few realize just how wide it is until they see it. Our eyes see in the 40-50mm range, so we're not used to perceiving such a wide field. When you look through this lens, you see pictures that you didn't even know were there.The glass quality is excellent, obviously not up to Canon L standards, but that was never the purpose. The pictures are SHARP and clear, and colors are excellent (tints tend slightly toward the warmer end when compared to Canon's 10-22mm; I like that, personally, but YMMV).Subjects are obviously deformed when shot up close at 10mm, but know what you're doing and that becomes a great tool for artistic pictures! You can shoot a 5'5\" person head to toes from less than 3 feet away. Also, I am happy to report that at 20mm there is NO distortion whatever, regardless of the subject's distance.The only problem I can see right now with this lens is a rainbow effect when shooting at 10mm in direct sunlight. The hood helps some, but you'll still get the rainbow in some pictures. See my pic in the customer image section. It's not a huge deal (sometimes it's actually a neat effect), and it's happened to me only once out of 800+ pictures taken, but know what you're getting.Overall, this is THE wide-angle zoom to get if you're halfway serious about landscape photography, although the Sigma also works great in indoors with limited room to shoot.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great and affordable wide angle!", "unixReviewTime": 1211241600, "reviewTime": "05 20, 2008"}

After many visits to the camera store, hours of internet research, and dozens of questions to professionals I bought this lens from Amazon. No local dealers bothered to carry it so once again the sale went to the internet.During my research it became obvious that one of the major limitations of many new DLSR's is a smaller overall field of view when compared to a traditional film based SLR using the same basic lens. Without going into the \"why\" the bottom line is my Nikon D40X's stock 18-55 cannot capture as wide a shot as I want.Terminology becomes an issue when trying to explain this lens to an amateur, or the person who might be involved with your new 500 dollar purchase. The word \"wide\" has new meaning these days when applied to TV's and monitors, so people are confused when you try to tell them about a lens that is \"wide\". This is significant because so many new D40X buyers, for example, are jumping into SLR for the first time and have no clue about lenses. These are the people who probably have no idea what they are missing.The overall focus on lenses gets further confusing for amateurs because of all the hype about \"zoom\", and when kits like the D40X give you an extra zoom but no wide lens. Zoom is like one of those numbers consumers make sure to ask about before they make their purchase. While zoom photography is cool, I feel the magic of wide-angle photography is a well kept secret. Consumers would be well served to be asking about \"wide\" instead, and start walking the camera up closer to their subject. You'll see why later.Doing research became even harder when I began to read about the Nikkor 12-24 and new 14 wide angle lenses. At $1000 and $1700 I began to feel like my dream would never come true. Then I held the new 14mm at the camera store, attached to a D60. It is a monster in every way. After looking at some dinky conversion lenses I was ready to give up. The amazing reviews of the new Nikon wide-angle lenses left me feeling it might be years away.That's when I found the Sigma 10-20, roughly 5 lenses later. The solid 5 star reviews combined with under-$500 price tag got me looking, and then the test shots. $20 of overnight shipping later I must say this is a product that should come with the camera. All new consumers should be made aware of what this thing can do. It should be bundled or at least sold beside these cameras, not the total mystery it seems to be. This wide angle lens should go into the hands of amateurs and professionals alike. It could be the factor that keeps new people into the hobby when their zoom shots are all messed up. Simply put this lens allows your camera to better match what you see with your eyes. The creative possibilities of a wider field of view should not be underestimated. It could sell more cameras, so it seems the competition should be looking up to Sigma, especially at this price tag.

Very noticable difference between the two. I also compared it with the Tokina 12-24mm.  Again, the Sigma was more compelling to me. It's got a sturdier feel to it and it performs better. Most impressive? The \"HSM\" or \"Hyper-sonic Motor.\" It's incredibly fast and quiet. You don't hear the a motor grinding its way into focus as you do with other lenses (you know who you are!).  Absolutely quiet.  And take a peak at the glass.  It's beautiful.  I haven't had a problem with ghosting at all.  And, I've taken some breathtakingly sharp shots with this lens.  Distortion?  Yes, at the extremes.  But, it's almost to be expected from a lens just a step away from being a fisheye lens.  I consider distortion from this lens as a non-issue.

In fact, I was impressed enough to purchase another Sigma: the 30mm F1.4 EX DC HSM.  Another great lens!Here's my update:This lens developed focusing issues a while back.  I'd describe the issues as an inability to lock in on an object and stay locked in.  The auto-focus mechanism, which has always been very quiet, quick and accurate, now seems to bounce around from near to far searching for a focus point before actually finding one.  This causes a delay in getting the shot - and the delay can range from a second to entirely preventing the shot from being taken (during that particular attempted shutter actuation). Even when the lens is directed towards a specific object - with sharp lines - it's as if the lens is being used at night and there is nothing to focus on.  Under those circumstances, the internal focus ring will quickly swing back and forth and then, having found nothing, will stop (as if to prompt the use to try another target.  The warranty has expired (not a 5 year warranty like Nikon) so if I want to fix it, I'll have to foot the bill myself.(I ended up buying the Tokina 16-24mm - very, very nice lens).I'm even more disturbed by this \"quirk\" because I've got two other Sigma lens which have had their own issues as well!  Am I incredibly unlucky?I've got a Sigma 70-200mm f/2.8 DG HSM II Macro Zoom Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras.  Out of nowhere, the auto-focus on the lens completely failed - on my D300 as well as my D90. Couldn't have happened at a worse time for me.

This aperture mechanism on lens has malfunctioned.  If I try to stop the lens all the way down to f22, the pictures end up being blown out - the complete opposite of what one would expect.  There's no function whatsoever for all f-stops between f11 and f22.  Of course, I bought the lens for it's use wide open - and it still works fine at 1.4.  But, the warranty has expired and, again, I'll have to foot the bill if I want it fixed.(I bought a Nikon 35mm f/1.8G AF-S DX Lens to replace it.

Here is why:When I received my lens I later realized that I did not receive the extended three year warranty card that comes with the USA versions of the lens. Instead of just sending me the extended warranty card Amazon shipped me a whole new lens. Now while I was reading reviews prior to ordering this lens I had seen many reviews where the reviewer either loved this lens or they hated it. After a while I could see why...Some of the lenses that are being shipped are sharp all the way around while some are not sharp at all. Many claimed it was sharper at F:8 than F:4 while others said theirs was never sharp at all. Some complained about distortion and or dull or over saturated colors. I finally found a reviewer who had the opportunity to try 3-4 different lenses. They found that there seemed to be a lack of quality control all around when it came to this specific lens. Having a few days of both lenses I decided to compare them out for myself. I am glad I did.I put my camera in the front yard on a tripod and shot numerous sets of three for each lens at 10mm, 14mm, and 20mm. The results were surprising. The original lens I had been sent first was a clear winner. The trees and anything else around the picture were sharp, The replacement lens was anything but sharp. The colors on lens two were more vibrant than lens one but one can fix that with software where a blurred image is not really fixable.I shot numerous sets with both lenses and a few different F settings and the results remained the same. The replacement lens was the one being returned. Lucky for me the Sigma extended warranty cards have nothing on them, you enter the serial numbers yourself so I kept the card and returned the replacement lens.I have included two photos to the gallery for this lens so you can see what I found. In the end my first lens would have received a 5 star rating because they really are excellent lenses if you can get a good copy. The replacement copy would have received a 1 star rating. Luckily I had the chance to compare the two copies side by side or I may have never known just how bad lens number two really was.If your lens has problems like lens number two you have a poor copy of the lens, return it. Sadly from all of the reviews I have read it seems that maybe 20% of the lenses are not good copies. Many just think poor sharpness is just a general lens limitation when chances are it is just a poor copy they received.Bottom line!1. Get the lens out and shoot some shots, If it is not sharp around the edges return it for another copy.2. If you do not get your extended warranty card you may have gotten a gray market lens. Return it.Upon talking to a Sigma rep I was told they have no way to verify whether the lens is USA or Gray market (international) by the serial number, if you do not have the extended warranty card you will not get the warranty extension so buyer beware. The card is a card stock type black and red folded warranty card that specifically states that it is the extended warranty card. Don't let any dealer tell you that it has the extended warranty without it being in your hands. Sigma currently has no registration on their website. The rep told me to keep the card in a safe place and then in the event that I need service I will send it and a copy of the original sales receipt in with the lens for service.All that being said I can tell you that this is a wonderful lens if you need a super wide angle lens and you get a good copy. They are not the fastest lenses around but for the money you cannot beat it.Take a look at the pictures I included for the lens and hopefully they will help you determine if you were lucky on the Sigma draw and give you an idea of what you need to check for.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Could be 1 Star, Could be 5 Stars!

After reading countess reviews of different PDA models, and suffering a great deal of sticker shock (600$ for a PDA?  Who the hell can afford that?)  I settled on the E2.

The E2 is an excellent, no-frills device that delivers on all the above points.  The good stuff:* The PIM features are generally easy to figure out without referring to an instruction manual.* Graffiti is a good deal easier to use than I thought it would be* Navigation is very, very intuitive, whether you do it using the stylus or the four-way navigation key.* I have seen people complain about the metal casing, but I find it very attractive and sleek, even if it does hold fingerprints.* It's conveniently sized-tiny enough to fit comfortably in my front pocket.*The battery life is astonishing-I've been fiddling with it almost continuously for days, and it still doesn't need charging.There are some negatives as well:* The device has a very tiny amount of on-board memory, so while it comes bundled with MP3 and audiobook software, you're not going to be making much use of them without a memory card.  Ditto for any extra software.* The palm memory cards are basically overpriced MMC cards, which you can purchase at any electronics store for a noticeably lower price.* There is no cradle or case, and no extra stylus in case you loose the one that comes with it.* Palm needs to stop wasting valuable space by etching a writing area at the bottom of the screen-why not just write anywhere on the screen, like the windows handhelds, and give us some more viewing space?On the whole, this is an excellent entry-level, no-frills handheld, and a good choice for someone who has never used a handheld device before (like me).

It took me the better part of a day to get versamail to send email through the phone's GPRS service.  If you are not technically adept, it may be easier for you to either buy a Wi-Fi card, or to pass on this and buy a more expensive model with built-in Wi-fi.

I tried using it for music, but it does not do this very well compared to an iPod or MP3 player (sound is fine though). The main drawback is the file conversion and loading process is not simple.

It still works reliably, and never lost the contents of its memory. Hotsync always worked great, and only the slowly deteriorating digitizer function (it got drifty and would not stay calibrated) entice me to look for a new version.Palm's website has a product recommending feature, and after I plugged in my expectations, it came up with the Tungsten E2. I was happy that I could buy it for less than $200, and it came with lots of nice software.I intitially could not get the Palm Desktop to install, because I still had the older version on my computer, and this caused an odd error message that had nothing to do with previous software versions. I could not find a way to email tech support through the Palm website, so I took a guess and emailed support@palm.com. I got a reply in less than 24 hours, with advice to make sure earlier software versions were not installed. Good for them that they got back relatively quickly, and good also that they gave me the right answer the first time. Bad that the software was unable to recognize an earlier version and respond with a prompt or other warning (as most software installer utilities will do).The E2 itself seems very nice, and the ease of use and nice display made me quite happy at first. I am worried about the non-replaceable rechargeable battery, since it seems that when that starts to lose its ability to hold a full charge, the unit will have to be thrown away...never had that worry with the old Palm III, which used replaceable alkalines! At least most modern rechargables have long useable life spans....Then the annoyances started. Just as soon as I had decided this was a keeper, and had chucked the packaging material (the retailer will not take it back without the plastic vacuum pack, even if it was destroyed in order to extricate the E2 in the first place), I noticed a very serious bug in the operating system (OS). The FIND function will not find more than 8 contacts, even if many more contacts match the search criteria. At first I thought they limited it to only 8, but remembering the identical function on the old Palm III, I could not believe this. Further checking showed that the screen says that it is able to 'find more?' if I tap a button, and when I do so it indicates that it is displaying additional matches, but it really just shows the first 8 matches again. This is a critical fault in a function that is really necessary for the PDA's primary purpose...that of storing and retrieving many contacts.I was tipped off, by the E2 forum in the Palm website, that this was a well known problem (wish I had checked this before buying), but also that there were other amazing bugs. One of these is the built-in calculator, which comes up with some real far out answers when using the % key. For example, 200 + 5% is 2.05? How about 210!!!!!Palm makes it as hard as possible to contact tech support and customer service, but I worked at it and finally had a so-called Level 2 tech support person on the line (from India, it sounded like, and they called me at 10:30 at night). They readily acknowledged the problems, but stated that Palm had designed the E2 without flash-upgradable OS, and with so many having been made, Palm decided to simply not take them back...can't fix the problem cheaply with a download, so ignore the problem and let the customer twist in the wind.The tech support person gave me a phone number and expediting code, which got me through to Palm corporate headquarters and a manager in customer relations. He plainly stated that the E2 did not have any bugs, since the things I was bringing up were actually designed that way, and as such were design features, not faults. No argument I made could get him to admit that this was a problem. When I pressed him for help and said his 'company line' was clear BS, he stated that the problems had gone as far as the CEO of Palm, who had decreed that the company would not admit a fault and would not fix, take back or in any other way remedy the problems. He said the company position is that the E2 is a 'low end' product, and cannot be expected to work as well as the more expensive products in their line!Well I cannot return my E2, cannot afford to throw it away and buy a more expensive one, and I do need a PDA that runs Palm OS applications. My solution was to spend another $40 and buy two after-market programs, a scientific calculator application and the IntelligentFind application. Both work fine, and unless the E2 starts to have problems turning on (as many have complained about), I suppose it will do a decent job until I grow tired of it in a few years.But, the real rub is that Palm used to be a fine company with a high quality, well thought out and manufactured product of high reliablilty. They are now simply a maker of a consumer commodity, rather like $5 calculators, and their service and support are about as good as one would expect from that scenario.

Remember what you want a Palm for: storing information in an easy-to-access manner.  For most people, it isn't supposed to be a mini laptop.  It doesn't matter if the specs haven't changed much over the years.  How much has a DayRunner improved in the past couple of decades?  Some innovations make sense, sure.  I've had several PDAs over the past few years because of specific things I wanted (rechargable battery, color screen, wireless access, etc.).  Now I have a E2 (for the Bluetooth, screen, design, and ease of use).  But at the end of the day, my usage has stayed pretty constant.  I want good PIM applications (personal information management) on a small device with a good screen and battery life and the ability to check my email.  That's all I want, and the E2 gives me that.  Sure, Palm could wow us with innovations, but I really can't figure out what they could introduce that would be a \"must-have\" feature.  Competing Windows Mobile devices don't offer anything particularly better either (unless you want a jack of all trades device that isn't particularly good at anything.  In other words, if you want a PDA, this one is great.  Here's why:1.  For most of the things that anyone does with a Palm, it works great.  In other words, the PIM features work great, and the direct synchronization with Outlook is fantastic (and a new feature only on the past few Palm devices).2.  The hardware and \"fit\" of the device is great.  This is the latest in the \"Palm V\" model and it shows.  No gimmicks, just a good device fit and design wise.3.  The Bluetooth feature is great, if you need/want it.  Setting up PC Bluetooth sync is easy if you follow the manual and the wizard on the device.  Using it with a phone is a much greater challenge due to the few phones supported directly by Palm.  Check first to see if yours is.  If not, there might be a work-around, but prepare yourself for a few hours on the internet trying to find one.4.  The fact that the memory doesn't get erased when the power runs out will be really helpful if you're prone to forgetting to charge your devices.The bad:1.  Versamail is incredibly difficult to work with.  By far it has taken me the longest time to find out that I can't use it to sync with Outlook as planned (this is because you can't directly Hotsync IMAP accounts with SSL security, nor can you sync an IMAP account to Outlook, points buried in Palm's website).2.  As mentioned, getting Bluetooth to work with an unsupported phone is a real pain and not the most reliable connection ever invented.3.  Yeah, yeah, it shows fingerprints, should have a power indicator light, and a cradle would have been nice.  A little too much cost-cutting, I think.Overall, I'm very happy with the E2.  It does what I want and probably more than what most people desire (most people probably don't need Bluetooth on a PDA).  If you don't care about Bluetooth or the non-volatile memory on the E2, get the Tungsten E and save yourself $50.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "It is great for many things, and not so great for a few", "unixReviewTime": 1114128000, "reviewTime": "04 22, 2005"}

I'm in between semi-pro and pro, and my main focus is wedding photography and engagements. I would say that about 90% of everything I shoot involves a person in some way, so please keep this in mind when reading my review. I am also a bit of a gear-head, in the sense that I love to stay current on knowing about the latest technologies. It is also important to know, however, that I do not necessarily believe that the latest and greatest advancements in photo tech are actually necessary, nor have I ever pre-ordered photography gear personally.INTROI first used the 5D in 2010 (well after its release) when a friend lent me their camera for shooting a wedding. I shot my first weddings on a couple of rebels - a big mistake. At the time I didn't realize how important camera cache, AF speed and low-light performance all were in wedding photography and it was an experience I didn't want to repeat if I could help it. The 5D completely changed the way I shot, and in my biased opinion, helped me become a better photographer. The first wedding I shot on one was a dream! Just so you don't think that I was awed by the step up alone, I have shot with the 5D MkII, 5D MkIII, ID MkII, IDs MkII and the 7D since then.BUILD QUALITYNow as another reviewer has mentioned, Canon came under fire from some in regards to the build quality...I won't rehash what has already been said on this topic but allow me to express how much I enjoy the build quality of the 5D. It is not the same as the 1D series that's for sure (I also owned a 1Ds MkII Full Frame), however it beats the rebels and even the XXD series by a LONG shot. The camera feels very sturdy in the hand, and has a nice weight to it (no doubt due to the alloy body). I have owned two of these cameras, and borrowed one extensively (thanks Mike!) and overall have had very few issues with all three copies. One camera did suffer from the well-documented mirror issue (glue coming undone) however I had a backup camera with me, and Canon glued the mirror free of charge (including a CLA to boot)! For those of you with 5Ds, please be aware that this is STILL being done, even if your camera is out of warranty.FEATURESNow, this is perhaps the most controversial point in digital photography. Allow me to let you in on a little secret: camera companies want to make money more than they want to make cameras. Boom - I'll give you a minute to regather your exploded head. I jest, however at the same time I am dead serious. Even the noble photographic giants such as Canon and Nikon have to answer to shareholders. The way they stay on top? New features. Some of them are super handy, HD video for example (if you shoot it) or even Live View (which I hated at first). Many of them, are absolutely worthless. Who needs a camera that goes up to 160,000ISO? I have a rule to never shoot above 800ISO, and even then only in good lighting conditions! I say all this to say, don't get caught up in the gear games - you don't need a camera that was made in the last 6 months to make good pictures. Here is a short list of features, that make the 5D classic a contender in 2012:- Full Frame. This is the main reason why most people buy this camera.- 12.8 MP - enough to make great-looking poster size prints. Do you really need more?- Extended ISO of 50-3200, more than you'll ever need.- Large and bright viewfinder, with 97% coverage- 17 RAW frames at 3FPS- FANTASTIC image qualitySHOULD YOU GO NEWER?There are a few reasons why you might want a newer camera. Now keep in mind, we are talking about a price jump of about $1000 for the 5D MkII (I'm ignoring APS-C cameras). Here are a few reasons why the jump might be worth it. If you find yourself nodding and pining for these features, then by all means go ahead. If, however, like me you don't think these are necessary for great pictures, move on!- Video capabilities- Larger LCDs with better resolutions- Live View- Faster FPS- Slight increase in image quality- Higher ISO, color bit rate and dynamic rangeIMAGE QUALITYI have to say that some of my best work has been done on the Canon 5D. Sure the 50D and 7D have newer sensors and processors, but when it comes down to it I can spot a shot from my 5D out of a batch of mixed files any day. Let's be honest for a second: image quality depends more on the glass you are using and the light available than your camera sensor. Sure, you will know if a picture was taken with an old Canon D60 (never heard of it? eBay has them for a hundred bucks), but overall the 5D keeps up with much never cameras. The full frame sensors allows for much nicer bokeh from closer up (google \"full frame better bokeh\" for a full explanation), something that is invaluable to a wedding photographer who doesn't get to control his or her environment.OVERALLI got my 5D in good used condition for almost the same price of an excellent used condition 50D (which my wife uses), but I rarely finding myself wanting to use the 50D. My wife gets some great shots and it is a fabulous camera, but having full frame really is that important to me. Will I upgrade to the 5D MkII/III? Of course I will. I do not believe, however, that it is worth a business loan. I have been using the 5Ds now for almost three years, and I will continue to do so until (a) they die, (b) I receive a surprise inheritance, or (c) Canon comes out with a full frame camera with new features I can't live without. If you are a serious photographer on a budget, don't let the manufacturing date scare you! The 5D is still a workhorse and I have met countless pro photographers that use them to this day. As long as my clients keep smiling in delight when they see their wedding pictures, I will continue to use this fine camera.A TIPThere is only one grip on Amazon for this camera (BG-E4 equivalent) that is vastly over-priced. I found a Jenis grip on eBay for less than forty dollars. It ships from China, however it has given me no problems whatsoever, and is of the same quality as any other third-party grip I have used (and I have owned five different brands).SUGGESTED ACCESSORIESI have used or I own everything listed below, and have rated them at 4 stars or above:Remote Shutter Release Cord for Canon EOS 5D(I use this for astrophotography - excellent!)2 Pack of High Capacity Batteries For Canon EOS 5D(less durable, but single charge lasts just as long as OEM)Jenis Battery Grip for Canon 5D (Black)(as mentioned above, search for this elsewhere!)Canon Ee-D Focusing Screen for EOS 5D(essential for good composition!)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "An in-depth review of a fantastic camera!", "unixReviewTime": 1340582400, "reviewTime": "06 25, 2012"}

Williams", "helpful": [10, 12], "reviewText": "I've owned the Canon 20D, the 30D, and the 5D Mark II and after doing much research and reading about various used full-frame cameras I decided to try this 5D. WOW!!! I LOVE IT!!! The reviews I read pointed out that this camera is a few years old in tech circles but the pictures it takes and the detail it captures is often preferable by Photographers who like the look of the portraits and landscapes it can produce -- even to the 5D Mark II. I owned the 5D Mark II (paid $2500 for it) and now I can add my opinion to the rest -- I like the colors, the clarity, and the file size of these 5D classic pictures more than the ones I took with my 5D Mark II (which I recently sold). And with the current used prices (under $1K) this is a full-frame dream come true. If you need higher ASAs that are very useable such as 3200 and above for your work, this may not work for you. Also if you need to do video with your camera you'll need the Mark II or another video producing model. More is not always better when it comes to megapixels and this camera (along with a 1Ds Mark II at 17mps) produces the most beautiful pics at sizes you can live with. I have a friend who owns a 1Ds Mark II and a 5D who absolutely loves his 5D. The used 1Ds Mark II also produces beautiful pics but costs about $750 more than the 5D at current used prices. Price was an issue for me. If I had the money, I would have gotten the 1Ds Mark II. But this is the way to go if you want full-frame quality at a screaming great price! Be warned that a full-frame camera will reveal the weaknesses and distortions of cheaper lenses so if you want to get the best results, invest into some quality lenses like Canons \"L\" pro quality lenses or research the cheaper ones to find which ones do well on full-frame cameras (like the bargain EF 50 f/1.8). I paired my 5D with a Canon EF 24-105 f/4.0 L IS (in a white box saves $200) and the combination is superb! And having a lens with IS is another dream come true! Leave the tripod home because you can get sharp pictures while hand-holding. A wonderful walk-around combination for hiking or traveling. If you are a journalist or a wedding photographer, you may want to invest into a 1D or 1Ds model, (with the larger body) which many reviewers say has a lightening fast focusing system which adjusts to perfect focus almost instantaneously and also can snap off more than (the 5Ds) 3 frames per second when needed. (Another feature I don't have to have).  I've found that the 5D is good at focusing on and tracking moving objects while the larger bodies (the 1D and 1Ds bodies) are superb in this area. I'm so in love with this 5D gem. I think it's got to be the best full-frame (large and highly detailed sensor) camera deal out there right now. And at under $1000 I think they are a screaming steal!

It fixes distortions, noise, exposure etc. that will transform your images into amazing ones automatically.  It costs twice as much for full frame bodies (3 bills) vs crop but is worth every penny.  Even if you use photoshop or whatever, just give the demo a try (dxo.com) and see what I mean!!!*Update* - currently using the Ee-S focus screen for DOF preview with my 50 1/4 since the standard screen could not handle the speed.  It's a great upgrade.  Focusing (manually) pops in perfectly.  Highly recommended.  Works well with slower lenses as well, just a slightly darker viewfinder.Five years ago I bought a Canon S40 (after using my father's Canon Pro 70) and at the same time I saw the 1DS and fell in love with the viewfinder and just knew full frame would be my next camera if my EYE improved.  Well, this summer I upgraded to the 5D. It was so much fun testing out new cameras because to me they are all just tools to help capture the images my eye sees.  I narrowed it down to three different bodies...Nikon D200, Leica M8 and Canon 5D.All three cameras are excellent.  The Nikon being the most feature rich. Leica, the best craftsmanship and simplest in design, and the Canon neatly settling in the middle.  Being that I like to shoot without flash 95 percent of the time, higher ISO performance was most important.  The Canon 5D pulled away at ISO 400 and beyond while still maintaining excellent dynamic range. One can use slower lenses because ISO 400 and higher are so clean.  And speaking about lenses, I found it so much easier to decide on what to buy for my purposes (50 /1.4 and 70-300 DO). Because a 50mm is just that, I use my feet and snap away. With the crop factor, it was not so easy. Just because a 35mm gives you a similar view as a 50mm on full frame the images look more distorted and just different.  Also, should one buy digital only lenses or full frame ones for the Nikon since they now have a full frame D3 on the horizon.  As for Leica, it had a 1.3 sensor so things would be interesting as well.Also surprising was how pictures looked when printed.  The Nikon was good but not quite up to the Canon and Leica (dynamic range) level.  The Leica was truly impressive until pictures with higher ISO printed.  Here the 5D shined and the larger I printed the bigger the difference not to mention the level of detail that was rendered. Bokeh was really smooth too.  What was truly amazing however, were images printed at ISO 3200 after a run through noiseware.  This left me speechless.Actually, as good as the 5D performed I realized it's not perfect by any means of the imagination.  It lacks a lot of pro features (because it doesn't want to step on big brother's toes - 1Ds II) like weather sealing, 5 fps, dedicated mirror lock-up button, and auto iso. It does however, makes one THINK about their photo.  Nikon has tried to simplify this by giving you auto everything.  That approach is neat and can give you the sense that it can capture the moment quicker and easier than the Canon or Leica. However, after using the 5D for a couple of months I find it simple and easy to use in addition to having a cleaner design with fewer buttons.  I must admit, the Leica was true joy, manual and all.  The rangefinder is so cool.  And the design so clean with virtually none of the wiz bang features of the Nikon.  One really does have to THINK about composing the image and manually focusing it.So, the 5D captured the best images for the way I shoot and the viewfinder is a true wow.  I have no problem seeing or framing the image. And the Canon system (great lenses and printers) is hard to beat. One really should shoot RAW to realize the true potential of the 5D.  However, the Leica M8 left an enduring impression on how I approach photography.Now, if only my EYE could improve...", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great but not perfect...", "unixReviewTime": 1190505600, "reviewTime": "09 23, 2007"}

They are affordable full size sensor camera.  Output quality will meets most of requirement given by the client.2. Battery is interchangeable with 20/30D, so it is ideal candidate for 2 camera configuration with 20D/30D.3. As far as Portrait photography are concern, it is currently one of the best in image quality and compared to the 1DS's older design sensor, when situation is ideal, it sometimes create superior result.4. Very low ISO noise, it is really useful for anyone who frequently shoot for low available light situation. ISO800 was useable even for the magazine purpose.5. Relatively lower shutter noise compared to the 20/30D that are helpful for some of noise sensitive shoot.6. Availability of third party add on are actually important to me when I looked for camera.  5D is very good with availability and compatibility or such 3rd party equipment.  And I am very happy to use many of 3rd party products with 5D.1DS, due to the its form, has major difficulty with some of affordable 3rd party tool, most notably bellows system.7. Weight is considerably less compared to the 1DS series and it is still full sensor size camera.8. DOF of full size sensor camera thus great Bokeh can be archived if used with great lens.9. Ability to shoot AdobeRGB color space RAW format10. Fairly easy to find additional equipment at the local camera store, when you are on the road (I thinkthat is very important)There are some disadvantage for this camera1. It is 12.8M pixel despite the fact it is full sensor (or Leica format) size and it is 4M pixel smaller than 1DS MKII.  And there are few occasion, it will not be enough for the given assignment(You really need to consider type of work you do)2. It does have lower burst rate compared to 1D MKII or 20/30D that is not exactly ideal for the performance art, sports events, or outdoor bird photography.Due to that fact, I normally bring my 20D with me, so if I need decent burst rate, I will rely upon my 20D instead.3.It is not weather sealed, thus, you really cannot take it out when weather is not exactly ideal without shortening camera's life.  So, it is not ideal camera for field photographer who shoot at challenging environment.4. It is still expensive for the amateur and, it is still expensive for the professional photographer with rather low fee structure.5. 9 point sensor is more than enough for the most of people.

Well four years ago I picked up the original Canon 300D Digital Rebel.  It was a great camera to learn with and I still enjoy looking back at my progress over the years.If you read any forums or discussions on photography web sites you will no doubt find that most experienced photog's will tell you to spend your money on glass before the camera itself.  That's the path I took and I could not be happier now that I have a great body to go with some great lenses.Instead of upgrading my archaic 300D (pushing a strong 6.5MP, useless above 400 ISO, in my opinion) over the years I've upgraded glass with a 15MM f/2.8 fisheye, 24-70 f/2.8L, 70-200 f/2.8L IS and a really sweet cheap lens - 50MM f/1.8 (everyone should have this lens, buy it now if you don't already have it).Finally I had the focal ranges covered (for now) but I really hated how long my 24-70 was on my Rebel.  This is the only reason I went for the 5D instead of the 40D.  Honestly, most people will never know the difference between 10MP and 12MP or 3fps and 6fps.  A full frame sensor is a whole new game when compared to a crop camera.  Believe the hype.Aside from the fact that my wide angle lenses are now actually \"wide\" the high ISO blew me away on this thing.  Crank this sucker up at 1600 and 3200 and take some photo's in low light, without a flash.  Go ahead, try it.  Incredible.So far this camera is worth every penny.  My only complaint would be that the on/off switch is a pain to use but I'm betting they do that to prevent you from turning it off accidentaly.  I guess I also wish the ISO was displayed somewhere without having to press the button.  And finally, like others have said, who really wants that direct print button?If you are trying to decide between the 40D and the 5D consider your lenses.  If you like long zooms, sports, etc. you will likely want the 40D.  If you enjoy wide angle lenses, don't need the burst rates and can see the value of the full frame - get the 5D.  Also, if you don't want to find yourself \"needing\" a Canon L lens or two, don't go full frame just yet.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "You've read the reviews, now buy this thing.", "unixReviewTime": 1195430400, "reviewTime": "11 19, 2007"}

It took about five or six months for me to really get to know the camera.  Now that it and I understand each other, I'm extremely satisfied with the images it produces.The controls are logical and well placed.  The fine gradations of f-stop, ISO, and shutter speed allow great control.  The grip is good and the build is very solid.  While I understand that the 5D is not weather sealed by Canon standards, I've taken it on a drizzly three day backpacking trip and many rainy weekend sports events.  Other than sluggish performance from cold batteries, I've never had a weather related problem.The 5D's dynamic range is also outstanding.  You may need photoshop work to rebalance light and shadows in high contrast situations.  An amazing amount of tonal gradation and detail is sometimes waiting to be brought to life in the dark and bright areas of a picture.Resolution is also outstanding.  I've been very pleased with the 13X19's I've made of many landscapes.  You'll want good glass for this camera, to squeeze everything you can out of that wonderful full frame sensor.  I really appreciate the way the full size sensor allows you to get a full 24mm wide angle out of a lens like the 24-105mm.Low light performance is also outstanding.  I shot an Xmas program picture in a church last week from a distance of 35 feet at 105 mm and ISO 800 (1/80, 4.0), with no flash.  There was faint (and manageable) noise in the shadows, but the spotlighted performers in the foreground were crisp and clear.  Wow!I miss having an in-camera flash, but the camera is almost too big and certainly weighs enough as it is.  I shot a wedding and reception some months ago, with a zoom lens and an external flash on the camera all evening, and learned a lot about how much the camera weighs.One minor complaint:  the auto white balancing is not perfect.  Images taken under indoor lighting without flash often have color casts.  Custom white balancing works pretty well, but if you're moving through different kinds of light, you may have processing work to do.Apart from the reservations I've stated, I'm really impressed and happy with my 5D.

If you are an intermediate or semi-pro photographer as I was when I bought this, you will be in for a rude surprise. This camera makes the 40D seem like a point and shoot.Now, when I say that I don't mean it in terms of image quality. I mean in terms of operation. On every cropped-sensor Canon DSLR that I have used, the fully automatic mode will do for 90% of shooting situations. On the 5D, the fully auto mode will work about 20-40% of the time. This is pretty much a straight manual camera. This is a camera for the old-schoolers who like to take 5 minutes in front of a subject before snapping a single picture. I used to be one of those old-schoolers a long time ago with my 80's Canon film camera, but I forgot a lot of the knowledge before jumping back into DSLRs with the Digital Rebel a while back.I used a Digital Rebel, a Nikon D80, and a Canon40D. All of those cameras are awesome but you know what? They spoiled me. They failed to challenge me as a photographer because they were so simple to use and so great in full auto mode.The 5D is forcing me to slow down and get back to the basics. It's forcing me to hit the books again and have some patience. I'm sure this makes the old-schoolers happy.Am I happy with this purchase? You betcha. I believe I will hang onto this camera for a long, long time. If I replace it as my primary camera, then I will still keep it as a backup.O.K. so you probably want the pros and cons.Pros:Image quality: Really is all that. Don't listen to the reviews saying the images are comparable to the 20D/30D/40D etc. They are wrong. No, you won't see the difference on 4x6 and 5x7 prints. Yes, you will see the difference on 8x10s and up. TRUST ME on this. I shoot with the 40D and 5D together and I see it every day. Would the average person on the street see the difference in 8x10s? Probably not. Will you? Probably, if you are someone with an eye that has been conditioned through hundreds of hours of viewing to see such things.Noise: the noise is virtually zero with this camera, even at ISO 400-800. At ISO 100 you couldn't find a bit of noise if you had a gun to your head. On my 40D (my current backup) there is plenty of noise even at ISO 100. Now, I use the word plenty in a relative sense--relative to the 5D. If I had not seen the images from the 5D, and the 40D was the nicest camera I had ever shot with, I would say the noise was great. After doing my own side-by-side comparisons, I would say the 5D makes the 40D noise level look \"so-so.\"Shutter speed: fine with me! I'm not shooting from the sidelines at an NFL game. I don't need the shutter speed of the 40D. The shutter speed is PLENTY fast on this one. I have never once said to myself \"I wish the shutter was faster just then.\" It takes nice bursts just fine.There are other pros of course but those are the ones that come to mind.Cons:Body: you pretty much have to get the grip for this one. I can not get a decent handle on this camera without the grip. I have tried and tried with different lenses, and every time the grip is necessary. It's strange, really. I don't know what accounts for this. I don't have the same problem at all on the 40D. In fact I even sold the 40D grip because I didn't need it. On here it is a must. Further body issues: I hate the on/off switch. Unfortunately the 40D has the same issue. I much prefer how Nikon puts it on the top near the shutter button.LCD: LCD is so small it's pretty much useless. I hardly ever use it. Sometimes my models ask me if they can look through a session on it and I always try to talk them out of it because it is a waste of time. A picture can look flawless on that thing and then you see it on a computer screen and it's utter crap.Price: still pretty steep, considering we are near the end of the cycle. This darn thing came out in 2005! That's a generation ago in DSLR years.Ease of use: now I do want to state up front that this is really more of an issue for those people who, like me, were buying the camera as an intermediate photographer. If you were already and advanced pro of course this probably would not have mattered to you. As an intermediate or beginner photographer, forget about it. Go shoot for a few weeks and then realize that you are missing 60% of your shots. Then do as I did and hit the books, which will give you not only the knowledge to unlock the full potential of the 5D, but will also give you a deeper understanding of photography in general. I guess I should thank the 5D for making me do this.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "It's 5/5 stars for sure; but it is complicated.", "unixReviewTime": 1199491200, "reviewTime": "01 5, 2008"}

I upgraded from the EOS 20D which was also a great camera.  I upgraded for a couple of reasons.  The first was the Full Frame sensor.

The one problem I've noticed with the Full Frame sensor on the EOS 5D is it is huge.  When you are changing lenses this sensor picks up every little piece of dust, dirt and fibers like a vacuum. I'm constantly cleaning the sensor with a blower.  I also had to bring it to a Canon service center. Just to remove some of the dust off the sensor that my blower could not remove.  The Canon service center was very far from my home.  (Very annoying).  I never experienced this problem with the EOS 20D.  But, the images you get from the full frame sensor are far superior to the smaller sensor on the EOS 20D.The other reason I upgraded was the larger LCD.  The 2.5' LCD screen is a nice plus.

Use the Sigma 12-24 on this baby and it rocks!- I am no pro, and I don't have light fall-off problem with my lenses, L or otherwise.- View finder is bigger and clearer, but not as much as I had hoped for.- Almost the same weight as 40D, same battery as 40D as well, same remote release.- Easier to clean the sensor, bigger hole and bigger area there.- Great LCD display, very accurate - which is very helpful in the field. 40D got a bigger LCD (3\" vs 2.5\") but I found the color and details on the 40D are way off.- Full frame sensor without the burden of ridiculously huge RAW file size - reasonable post processing and storage chores.Neutral:- 5D has the old menu system where all items are displayed in one long list, whereas 40D divides menu into tabs. 40D is faster but 5D is just fine.Con:- No Live-View: very important for fine macro shots.- No auto-sensor cleaning. The auto-cleaning on 40D is not perfect, but very helpful.- No user menu tab as on 40D.- No pop-up flash - which is useful for fill flash.- Internal processing is horribly slow. It struggles with each shot as reflected in the extra slow display on the LCD using a 4G SanDisk Extreme III card. On 40D the LCD shows the picture instantly.- 3 RAW per second seems to be a stretch. This one is not for action shoots for sure. But I bought it for landscape so I am not worried.Some of the issues are addressed in Mark II. But the Mk II got a huge boost in mega pixel counts - hens higher noise and far bigger file size to drag around with. To me personally, a build-in flash, a better view finder (100% instead just 96%) would be far more useful than the mega pixel count and HD video. A second CF slot would be great as well. It'd be nice if there're after-mart place where these features can be customized into the camera, like cars and bikes...Bottom line - it is great for low light and wide angles.

I looked at Nikon and Canon seriously, and thought about:1. full-frame v.s. crop sensor2. build quality3. pixel size4. cost-benefit ratio5. lens availabilityWhen I purchased the Canon 5D it was the only full-frame sensor at a reasonable price point. It still is! The Nikon full-frame 12 megapixel is astronomically costly, and the professional-series Canons are way, way outta my range. My verdict? Good cost-benefit ratio.(What does full frame mean? For me it meant silky, creamy images with a big dynamic range and no visual noise. Within an hour of opening the box, I had breathtaking results. My ugly dog looked charming and loveable. The flowers on the patio looked wedding-worthy. My freaking lawn furniture seemed so inviting...! I'm telling 'ya that a camera should be able to show you the world...even your familiar world in a new and exciting way...and it seems like magic that, even while learning to use the 5D, it allowed me to re-discover the beauty of my world!) Full-frame also means no conversion factor with lenses. If you loved your old 35 slr film experiences, this will be like falling in love all over again. You can get for-real wide angle, and an 85 mm portrait lens shoots true. (As for Vignetting...schmingetting...get yourself some darn software if it's a problem. You're gonna shoot the good stuff in RAW anyway, so spring for Photoshop CS3.)2. Build quality-feels substantial. I understand there aren't the weather seals that exist on the pro series, so be a little kind to your camera.3. Pixel size: the 12 plus megapixels make for amazing quality images.4. Cost-benefit: best price for the features!5. Lenses: Canon has a wide range of lenses, including the excellent fixed focal length primes. My personal faves are the 50mm and 85mm. The first gives you a \"transparent\" view of the world. The lens sees pretty much what you see, but records every detail crisply. The 85mm wide open gives the soft out-of-focus background blur called \"bokeh\" that makes everything you shoot look tender, and focusses on the details you want to capture: the whiskers on a kitten, the bright eyes of a child...all in an environment of softness. Great lenses and a lot of bang for the buck. And, Canon has a huge and growing number of image-stabilized lenses, as well as \"l\" glass super-high quality lenses.I love my 5D. It's my new best friend for gadding about town, and for \"seeing\" my world in a new way.The downside of the 5D: I wish that I were more quick and adept at changing settings. It may be partly product design, it may be partly me, but it is difficult for me to get to a comfort level with making quick decisions and changes. Fumbling with controls is not creativity. I guess though, that if I practice enough, and get familiar enough, that I will gain more competence in making quick adjustments and getting those golden shots.Final Analysis: 5D rocks. Yes, they will be developing cheaper, smarter, easier-to-set cameras with more megapixels...technology is improving all the time. But, there is such a thing as a \"sweet spot\"-and 12 plus megapixels on a full-frame seems to get it almost every time. So, go ahead, do the research, and while you are at it, consider the 5D.

If you are one of them, just buy a 5D Mk I.  Get a 5D Mk II if you want to take great movies too.The 5D MkI is better than every other DSLR for a few reasons:1.  The pixels are larger than any other professional-caliber camera2.  The sensor is full frame, 3X larger than low cost DSLRs3.  Wide angle capableThe reason 1 is important is because the more electronics (Megapixels) you cram onto the silicon, the more noise you get.  More pixels is worse in this respect, not better.  In bright light, zillions of little pixels are fine, since noise is not dominant.  But in low light, which is basically every picture with a shutter speed slower than 100th of a sec or so, noise is the primary quality consideration with digital.  The 5D takes fantastic low light pictures, because it has such a large sensor without too many MPs, and that gives you huge, light-gathering pixels.As all good photographers know, you need a flash almost all the time, especially in full sun.  The 5D's large pixels allow you to capture lots of ambient light, so harsh light from the flash doesn't dominate the scene.  This allows gorgeous bright-light scenes with fill flash, and also beautiful ambient exposures in settings as dim as a candle.The reason 2 is important is because it effectively makes your lens 3X brighter by soaking up light with 3X the sensor surface area per unit time.  High quality fast glass is incredibly expensive, so don't waste that light by projecting it around (off of) a small sensor.The reason 3 is important is because you get the largest possible rectangular crop (36mm x 24mm) out of the circular lens projection, meaning you get a much wider field of view.  This makes for wide angle capabilities there are beyond the realm of possibility for most DSLRs which have a small sensor sitting in the middle of a large lens projection.  You can buy a whole set of wider lenses for those cameras, but you lose optical quality and pay the same money in the end.  Small sensors are commonly thought to give a zoom advantage on the tele end of the lens line, but of course they don't because you can crop any picture you take with a full frame camera for the exact equivalent of what the cheaper DSLRs are doing.Nikon has countered with a full frame 12MP DSLR which meets all of the above criteria above, but I personally favor the rich colorful glass of the Canon L line.

That lens was horrible. When I read many good things about this new 70-300mm IS lens, I thought it was time to upgrade.  But, it was difficult to decide whether buy this lens or theCanon EF 70-200mm f/4L. I bought this lens and it was my mistake.While it has numerous improvements over the 75-300mm IS, there are still some shortcomings with this lens that keep it from competing with the similar-priced 70-200mm f/4L.First, starting at around 150mm-200mm and getting worse as you approach 300mm, this lens gives images that look soft (no, I'm not using any filters!).  This is not an issue of focus, but of low-cost consumer-grade optics.  You can stop the lens down and get some improvement, but then you lose your depth of field. (EDIT: The sharpness problem with my lens was the result of using it in portrait-orientation, a defect among the first batches of this lens.  Canon repaired the lens for free and it became sharper, no matter the orientation, but still not as good as the 70-200mm f/4L).Second, the focusing speed is slow.  New in this lens is variable-speed focusing; as the zoom passes 200mm, the focusing speed slows.  I assume this is to prevent the missed-focus hunting common with its predecessor.  But, this makes it harder to track moving objects and keep them in focus.Third, this lens suffers from very ugly purple chromatic aberration.  This lens really shows this problem too, in that even small bright objects develop purple halos.Finally, the lens gets larger as you zoom, the lens gets larger when you focus, the front of the lens moves when focusing, the focus ring moves when auto-focusing, the zoom retracts by itself when pointed upward (EDIT: last item was fixed by Canon during the above-mentioned service), and I'm sure there's more I'm forgetting... But none of these problems exist with the 70-200mm f/4L.This is not \"the hidden L lens\" as one reviewer said, it is nothing but a common consumer lens with a big price tag.  The IS feature is the single sole benefit.  If you have very shaky hands you might just need this lens.  If you have very steady hands, with IS you can use this lens in the dark of night (assuming you have a very still subject).  The 200-300mm range is nice in theory, but a tack-sharp photo from the 70-200mm f/4L at 200mm is going to look better cropped than a 300mm full-frame photo from this lens.If what you want is a very high quality lens that will give you sharp photos in daylight; buy the 70-200mm f/4L lens instead, it even comes with a hood.  The hood for the 70-300mm IS lens is another $40, making the 70-200mm f/4L a lower priced lens (and it even comes with a bag!).UPDATE 10/3/11: I'm now using my 70-200 f/4L with a Canon 7D and it is fantastic. I cannot fathom why people even consider this 70-300 given the economical availability of the 70/200 f/4L. The extra 100mm and IS isn't worth it given the major drawbacks of expanding size, rotating front element, plastic construction, and lack of comparative quality. You don't need IS as much as you think you do, especially if you've been taught how to shoot steady and follow the simple rule of using exposure speeds that are numerically higher than your current zoom setting (at 200mm make sure it's at 1/200 exposure time or faster).", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Not a bad lens.

I already had the Canon 55-250 and was getting pretty good shots, however, I wanted more reach.  The 400L and 600L were way out of my pricerange so my options were stick with the 55-250 or get this lens.  I did a google search re comparing this lens with the 55-250 and got lots of threads on photo forums where this was discussed.  Most comments indicated if you already had the 55-250 it was foolish to spend $400 to get the additional 50 since you could gain the same by walking a few steps closer to your subject.But walking closer is not always an option.  I enjoy photographing kiteboarders and surfers in action and walking a few steps closer means being up to my waste in water.  Likewise shooting other types of sports action you can't walk onto the playing area in order to get closer to the subjects.So I bought this lens and am very glad I did.  Now the subjects come closer to filling the frame and the photos are clearer and sharper than those taken with my 55-250.Yesterday I had an experience that would have convinced me I made a wise decision if I had any doubts.  When shooting kiteboarders I normally shoot Tv at 1/1000 because they are moving so fast and I don't want blurring.  Yesterday the wind was very good and the kiteboarders were going airborne.  I had a field day and was certain I had lots of good shots.  Until just before leaving I noticed that I was in P and had been shooting at a slower speed.  I felt almost physically sick thinking about all the good shots that I'd messed up by forgetting to switch to Tv 1/1000.  Staying and taking more was not an option because the wind had died down and the best kiteboarders had come ashore.What a wonderful surprise to upload those photos to my computer and find that even though shot between 1/395 and 1/512, more than I would have expected based on my experience with the 55-250 were keepers.  1/1000 would have been better, but the photos were sharper than had I been shooting with the 55-250 and because I was shooting RAW and the blurring was minimal, I could correct for much of what there was in post processing.This lens is definitely sharper than my 55-250.  I have confirmed this many times over as I pull together photos of kiteboarders to make a kiteboard gallery.  The photos taken with both lenses are good, but those taken with this lens are a little sharper, a little clearer, and require less post processing.And the subjects fill more of the frame, the  desire for which was a major reason for buying the lens.I like to have a hood on my lenses to prevent possible flare, however, because this lens is long I decided against the plastic-type hood I have on other lenses.  Instead, I purchased a rubber lens that you can collapse.  It is not as deep as the plastic hood for this lens so doesn't make the lens appear excessively long when in use, and because it collapses it takes up less space in the camera bag.Finally, I'm using the lens on a Canon T2i, which is smaller than most of the other Canon SLRs.  However, I have a battery pack, which makes the camera larger and provides more places to hold it.  If it were not for the battery pack, I believe this lens would be difficult to manage on the T2i because of its length and weight; the weight is about the same as the camera without the battery pack.  It is noticeably longer and heavier than the 55-250, which is a better size for the camera without a battery pack.  So if you are thinking of using this lens on a T2i, I suggest you also consider getting a battery pack so that the lens is attached to a larger, heavier camera than is the case without the battery pack.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Beats My 55-250", "unixReviewTime": 1327795200, "reviewTime": "01 29, 2012"}

Not to mention, once you factor in the cost of a good quality teleconverter, well, you may as well just look at theCanon EF 70-300mm f/4-5.6L IS USM--and while I did seriously look at that lens and test it out, the price point is really beyond what I want and need.That left me with this lens, and the Tamron. After pouring over dozens of review sites, I ended up ordering both. I just couldn't decide. This lens arrived first, and I'll admit--I was disappointed by the first shots. I generally shoot with primes (Canon EF 50mm f/1.4andCanon EF 85mm f/1.8 USM), and this lens just seemed to lack that visual punch I'd gotten used to. Then the Tamron arrived, and unfortunately, it was a dud. Many technical reviews suggest that the Tamron can outperform this lens--if you get a good copy. But for whatever reason, quality control seems to be a real issue for the third party lens manufacturers. But time was of the essence, so I decided to put this Canon lens through its paces at my zoo photography class.And boy, am I glad I did. I was pleasantly surprised--wowed, really--by what this lens could do when I gave it a real chance. So even though I wasn't thrilled with this lens at first impression--it certainly wasn't a case of love at first sight--it's become a keeper. It's probably not for everyone (there are many who argue the best option would have been to go with the 70-200 L + a teleconverter, or to suck it up and just get the 70-300 L), but it works for me.***After a month of use, I'll update this and add--I finally did a bit of pixel creeping comparing this lens to the 70-300 L that I tested out. The L seems to have a slightly better (more effective) IS system, but for my purposes I found it very difficult to distinguish between the image quality of the two lenses--even at the max focal length of 300mm. If I were a pro and intending to sell my photographs with the potential of blowing them up at a very massive scale, then the L would hands down be the better choice. But for me, and probably most people (your average consumer, prosumer, or serious amateur/hobbyist), this older version is an excellent lens. There's a reason many people, for years, called this the secret L--because it can really perform if you let it. I think that warrants adding the fifth star.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Wasn't Thrilled at First, But It Grew on Me", "unixReviewTime": 1367020800, "reviewTime": "04 27, 2013"}

Pickering", "helpful": [30, 31], "reviewText": "When purchasing my new Canon EOS 40D I wanted to get an additional lens that would add an extended zoom range from the 28-135mm lens that came in the kit.  I had a budget of $2,500.00 for a digital SLR camera, hot shoe flash, additional lens, memory card, and a large gadget bag.  I wanted to purchase the best quality camera that I could get, so I had decided to purchase the EOS 40D by Canon (kit with 28-135mm lens), but that meant that I would have to sacrifice money spent on the other accessories.  I purchased a 4GB Sandisk Extreme III CompactFlash card, and the Canon Speedlite 580EX II flash with the camera, so that meant I had roughly $675.00 for another lens and a nice camera/gadget bag.  I researched the Canon EF lenses extensively and decided that I had to have a lens with image stabilization.  I wanted a Canon lens and wanted it to have a large zoom range.  All reviews I read pointed to the Canon EF 70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM lens as a solid choice.I ordered this lens from Amazon and got a great price, and with free shipping.  The first thing I noticed is that this lens is lightweight and feels very well made.  The light weight did concern me a little, because I typically process the thought of lightweight electronics gear with cheap build quality.  Well I am convinced that this Canon lens does NOT suffer from cheap build quality.  The lens feel solid, and the focus and zoom rings are not sloppy at all.  The auto focus is fairly fast (although it can be a little slower in the highest zoom range), and the image stabilization works great.  As others have pointed out, this lens produces a somewhat softer looking image above the 200mm range.  However, the contrast and color remains sharp, even at maximum zoom.  If you don't mind giving up some depth of field by adjusting the aperture, you can get very clear images at the full 300mm.My biggest complaints with this lens are as follows:-  The end of the lens rotates when focusing, which causes the constant need to adjust my circular polarizer.-  The zoom changes the length of the lens.-  If you tip the camera at a sharp verticle angle, the zoom adjustment of the lens will retract on its own.-  Auto focus becomes slower at higher zoom setting.-  Having the lens set to AF prevents you from fine tuning the focus manually (there seems to me a mechanical, gear-type lock of the focus ring when AF is engaged)Overall I am extremely happy with this lens, even with the few shortcomings mentioned above.  The auto focus is accurate and fairly fast, the IS feature is rock solid, and the light weight of this lens makes it very good for handheld shots and does not cause balance issues when using a monopod or tripod.  Although I have noticed some minor softness in photos above 200 or 250mm, my pictures always look clear and contain excellent contrast and color.  I'm sure you could get better results from a Canon professional lens, which would cost you well over a grand for this kind of zoom range, but for the average hobby photographer I think this lens is about as good as you can get; and it can be had for under $600.  I am confident that this Canon EF 70-300mm lens will last for many years to come, and I would definately buy it again.  I hesitate to recommend this lens for a professional photographer, but for everyone else it is an excellent choice.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A Powerful, Versatile Lens for Consumer Grade Digital SLR Cameras", "unixReviewTime": 1201132800, "reviewTime": "01 24, 2008"}

Its my most used lens and I have taken some really nice photos with it. Here is my take....It handles well on my rebel xti. There is ample space on the barrel to rest it on my left hand and get a nice weight balance, and still turn the big grippy zoom ring. The zoom ring is easy to turn but not loose. Although the focus ring turns during auto-focus its out of reach from my hand. You can reach the IS switches easily by feel without looking. You have to press them a bit to get them to move, but it is impossible to accidently switch them. The AF/MF switch is hard to get to, but I don't MF that much anyway. The build quality is solid and typical of a canon mid-range/non-L lens.AF is fast and accurate. It does have a habit of hunting at 300mm if focus is way off to start with. All other focal lengths are fine. AF noise is very quiet but not silent like my EF 17-40L.The Image stabilization (IS) is excellent!!! If you have good handholding technique you can get blur free (or close enough) still photos to 1/30th second at any focal length. If your hand holding technique is sloppy IS won't help as much. IS really adds to the versatility of this lens.The image quality is great. The images are sharp at any focal length. (I mostly shoot around F4-5.6). The bokeh (quality of the blur) is very smooth, and better than my 50mm 1.8 which can be a bit \"nervous\" at times. Colors and contrast are good.I am glad I bought this lens instead of the EF 70-200 F4 L non-IS. The L has better build, and (the consensus is) better image quality. But I have never thought, \"Dang, I wish this lens was sharper or was built better\". But I have thought \"Boy, I'm so glad I have image stabilization right now\" and \"I'm glad my lense is less conspicous than the larger white L lense\".

Small.  This is great to throw into your pocket (but put in a case!)2.  Menu's on the Nano are really easy to use, and has a lot of options that are not useless... calander is nice.. as well as the clock.. but the most attractive is the ease of use for getting to your music.  A slow monkey could figure this one out.3.  Good/Great sound.  This device has good pump to it.  Not much else to say other than that...4.  Battery... well, this is a pro and a con... the battery is adverted as something like 18 hours.  There is no way you can get even close to that.  I get like 6 hours top.  And, even though apple once again lied about the battery life (I have owned four other Ipods of which never made any of their adverted battery lives) 6 hours is still very good amount.  -what gets me is this... I can't figure out why it is that the nano doesn't get 18 hours.. I mean, there is no moving parts... the screen is nice, but it isn't that super bright.. and it is small... hmmm.5.  Flash memory.  I have always... always.. been a major fan of flash memory ever since I first read about it a couple of years ago.  This has made the nano a big time operator in the field of Mp3's.6.  It looks great.  Why do all the other Mp3 players look like they were made in a 198o's communist country?  They are way ugly.  WAY WAY UGLY.  Matter of fact, apple is not all that great in the internal design or ruggedness of thier iPods.. I have replaced 3 of the four I have bought.. so they stinko when it comes to durability - but they look so much nicer than the way ugly stuff offered by Dell, or any of the other ones (creatives stuff is just missing a gene)... Sony is supposed to have a model out using flash, but have not seen it yet.. lets hope they can construct something that is not just way ugly.  So, apple whups up on the competition in many areas, but one area is the appearance of the product... Who wants to spend 200 dollars on something that looks like S$$T??  Not me.  And apparently not millions of other people.Cons.1.  Battery, see what I wrote above.  Like I said earlier, it is enough battery for me at 6. hours.....  but it would have been nice if it would have got close to the adverted battery life ...2.  It is prone to scratchness and difficult fingerprinting.  But, having read about that, I bought a case... and the fingerprints are hard to remove.. which is annoying... materials could have been better chosen I think...3.  I think the usb could have been  used better.  Not crazy about the hook up at the bottom of the nano.. why not just regular USB hook up, instead of this crazy wide thing?  Silly.  The Hook up on the shuffle is superior to this.  but o well.Overall a great device, but not five star.  I like it a lot, and when I get through with it, I will most likely toss it in the bin and get another.UPDATE**************I bought the case/skins from Apple.  They came in a case of five, and I picked out the lime green one to put on.  It was skin SKIN SKIN tight.  Very hard to get on, but once it was on, it was very sleek.  Actually, when you show someone the nano, you will have to tell them that the case is already on, it is that tight.  And, it is rubberish... and grabs the hand when you touch it.. very good to keep it from slipping out of your hand, etc... when moving.  I really REALLY recommend these cases, due to them protecting it, and over all 'cool' factor.  I place mine in my pocket and have had no issues with the case on it.++++++++++++Another UPDATE ++++++++++++I liked the apple skins, they were nice... but my wife went out at christmas and bought me and INCASE case for my ipod, and it is vastly superior to any case I have had for any of my iPods, and I have had four of them.  So, do yourself a favor, and protect your iPod with Incase cases.  They are under 30 dollars and are made of leather and are quite rugged.

However using the mini name just wasn't going to cut it and this device is amazingly small. Think two iPod shuffles but only flatter and weighing a svelte 42 grams and you start to get the picture.The casing is split in two sections, the iconic silver backing found on all the iPod models and depending on your model either a shiny white cover or shiny black cover. Apple has opted to make the click wheel themselves this time and that means that it's a rougher texture than iPod users will be used to. As to whether that's a good thing or not, we think this actually helps.Concerns over the scratchability of the player are rightly so and I would recommend anyone thinking of buying one to invest in some sort of protection from day one. I took it out of the packaging, put it in our pocket with some change and a mobile phone. Five minutes later I took it out again and it already had a faint scratch on it.Connecting to iTunes, users will be able to opt for the same experience as previous iPod models and there is even an Autofill option that will randomly fill your iPod with tunes from your collection if you've got too many to fit on the 2Gb or 4Gb offering.2Gb will get you around 500 songs and 4Gb 1000 tracks as long as they aren't all 13 minute John Coltrane numbers.Because of the photo-viewing element, you can also sync the nano with iPod Photo on an Apple Mac. As with previous models you can opt to sync your entire photo collection or specific rolls or albums.The main cause of amazement is that the nano has a screen built in such a small and thin device. Taking a leaf out of the iPod Photo, the nano features a bright colour screen, if not a bit on the small size, but still able to view image you've transferred via your computer.Digital photographers however will be upset to hear that the Apple Digital Camera connector doesn't work on the nano nor can you get a cable to be able to view the images on a nearby television. Viewing back you images on the screen is more likely to be a reference option rather than something worth straining your eyes over.Those bored of the music can head over to the in-built games, challenge themselves at their own music collection with the music quiz, play miniature solitaire or even bricks - Apple's version of Breakout.VERDICTThere is no doubt that this is going to be one of those must have devices if you haven't already signed up for the iPod revolution. The sleekness of the device means it will garner oohs and aahs from all over, heck Mrs Pocket-lint got excited by the smallness of the box it came in let alone the player itself.What makes this a winning combination is the iTunes software and how easy it is to use. Okay so the catches are that you will be tied into Apple's iTunes Music Store and the Apple file format for the foreseeable future, but when it's this good, who cares?Our final and most important piece of advice however to any would be buyer; make sure you get a protective case from day one, else your shiny new toy will have more scratches on it than a funky renegade dj's record collection.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Very classy...", "unixReviewTime": 1132531200, "reviewTime": "11 21, 2005"}

Greenberg", "helpful": [58, 60], "reviewText": "I bought a 4GB Nano because I wanted a flash player I could use while exercising, but that's not the only reason.  I also was curious about why the iPod in its various permutations has become such a cultural phenomenon.  I'm an older guy who can remember when the only \"portable player\" was a small Japanese transistor radio, so I've seen a lot of changes in audio technology during my lifetime.  The original Sony cassette Walkman was revolutionary in its day; the first portable cd players, with their virtually nonexistent antiskip functions, were considered a marvel. We've come a long way, baby.For years now I've been content to use a good-quality portable cd player for my on-the-go music, along with Etymotic ER-4P canalphones, a tiny, twin earplug-like device that makes the headphones packaged with any commercial portable seem laughable by comparison.  In the past few years, however, I have watched as the \"iPod revolution\" totally transformed the world of tiny audio, to the point where it's now virtually impossible to find a portable cd player with good sound quality. Portable digital players rule!So I decided, what the hey, I'll give this new technology a try! I bought my Nano, along with a small leatherette case to ward off the apparently inevitable scratches this player suffers if you don't cover it up with something protective.  Proving that you can, in fact, teach an old dog new tricks, I quickly learned how to use the iTunes software, and I began loading my cd's onto my computer hard drive and, in turn, into my Nano's flash memory.Two weeks into this Brave New World of Nano, my verdict is mostly positive, but definitely mixed.  First of all, this thing is, indeed, FUN.  Having a tiny, card-like device packed with hundreds of songs (or classical \"movements\") induces a definite feeling of power and control.  At your fingertips!  The fact that you can create \"playlists,\" add or remove music quickly using the  provided USB connection cord, and adjust the EQ with a just a few touches of the \"clickwheel,\" induces near-giddiness sometimes. The battery life is impressive; it's not the 14 hours Apple claims, but it's lengthy enough that one seldom has to worry about the battery running down unexpectedly.I haven't loaded any digital photos, podcasts or audiobooks, but hey, I feel good knowing that I can!So indeed, I think I understand why people are so smitten with this little gem of a device.  HOWEVER--the news isn't all good, and the most significant \"bad news\" involves what I consider to be the bottom line for any device that plays music, i.e., the sound quality. Most people \"rip\" and encode their music either as Mp3 or AAC files.  By eliminating what is considered \"less important\" music information, these compression systems allow digitized versions of musical files to be far smaller than the full versions represented most commonly by WAV files.  It's through the use of file compression that one can fit the advertised \"1000 songs\" on a 4GB Nano.Although some fans of compressed formats swear that no human being can tell the difference between compressed and uncompressed musical formats, don't believe it.  The old saying, \"there's no such thing as a free lunch\" definitely applies here. Fortunately, you can choose to eschew file compression by navigating into the iTunes software and selecting to encode music using \"Apple lossless format.\" All iPod owners actually should do this at least once, encoding the same song using both AAC and \"lossless\" technology, so that they can discern whether the difference is significant to them.  To me, it is, so for much of my music I have chosen to use the \"lossless\" format, meaning that I don't get nearly as many minutes of music on my Nano as I would have using AAC.But the fact is that even using \"lossless\" format, the sound quality is not quite equal to that exhibited by even a fairly inexpensive portable cd player. I'm probably nitpicking here, but prospective buyers of this device should know that one is, in fact, trading audio quality for small size, convenience, and design \"cool.\"  Caveat Emptor.Two more points regarding sound quality: first, those distinctive white earbuds that are packaged with the player are not bad by  \"included in the box\" standards, but their rendition of sound is mediocre.  Anyone who really cares about sound quality should save up to buy a better set of earphones.  If you truly care about sound, bite the bullet and buy some Ultimate Ears Super fi 5 Pro in-ear monitors (they apparently were engineered with the iPods in mind) or a pair of the new Shure earbuds that are also excellent.  These will seem incredibly expensive, but if you listen to a lot of music, it's an investment that definitely will prove worthwhile over a period of several years.Second, keep in mind that the software/firmware that drive the iPods has limitations that some users will find irritating. Yes, I'm an Old Guy, but over the years I've developed an affection for certain kinds of electronic, nonstop dj mixes of dance music, the kind in which one song blends seamlessly into another. I also still listen to the Grateful Dead, well known for their ability to segue from one tune to the next.  And keep in mind that even some more mainstream \"pop\" artists, including the Beatles, have utilized the nonstop blending of tracks in their albums.Well, the iPod can't handle nonstop. It invariably inserts a small gap in between tracks, even if one is not intended.  You can minimize this using the \"crossover playback\" function, but this really is not a satisfactory solution.  You also can record cd's as one joined track, but then you lose the iPod's celebrated display of individual track names.  In fairness, this is an issue that seems universal among digital players (with the exception of the now-discontinued Rio Karma 20 gb player).  But until Apple comes up with a firmware upgrade that addresses this issue, the lack of \"gapless playback\" will continue to indicate that in some ways the new, hip digital players actually represent a movement backward in sound reproduction technology.Overall, the victory of tiny digital players over previous formats, including CD, represents the triumph of convenience and cool, with sound quality apparently emerging as a secondary consideration for nearly all buyers. So I confess: there's a part of me that's bothered by the fact that in today's world, style, image, cool, and technology-as-fashion-accessory has become more important than actual sound quality in the marketing success of portable audio devices.  I know, I'm a curmudgeon; I can't help it.To conclude: on balance, I like my Nano, and I use it almost every day.  When I want to hear music as it was intended to be heard, however, I use my old iRiver SlimX cd portable (no longer made).", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Hip and cool and fun, but sound quality is secondary", "unixReviewTime": 1131062400, "reviewTime": "11 4, 2005"}

The screen is a very resolution so it can show more information than the larger screen on the mini, not to mention that it's also in color.  The sound quality is great and it has a very good range of volume levels.  This player is another good one from Apple and an improvement over the mini.  My only problem I have with Nano is that any finger prints shows up on the black surface and the shiny metal back.  The black surface is very easy to scratch.

{"reviewerID": "ARVD6Y9Z1E4D4", "asin": "B0007Y79B2", "reviewerName": "G. Kline \"art & technology\"", "helpful": [40, 51], "reviewText": "UPDATE:I have ended up buying an iPod Nano afterall.  My first review was from my initial experience and what I learned from a few other owners.  But after getting a chance to use one for a full day, I came to realize that some of my earlier complaints about the Nano needed revisiting and so I decided it was time to buy it (note: the $50 extra for 2 more Gb is worth it!)#1: Durability - overall, the unit is well made. The \"click wheel\" is smaller than the standard iPod, but still works as well. It is a very small device, so it is easy to drop it. I have heard it is fragile upon dropping onto a hard surface. Also, the shiny surfaces are scratch prone (both the glossy plastic front and the chrome back). So the best way to avoid these kinds of problems is to cloak the Nano in a casing of your choice (see below). Once you do that, you're good to go.#2: Form factor - it really is \"just right\".  It's small enough to fit in your pocket and yet large enough to hold comfortably in your hand.  I'd actually prefer it to be slightly thicker and accommodate 8Gb!  But for what Apple did with this device design, I have to applaud them.  It is solid feeling, yet light enough to strap on your arm and not really notice it is there (great for the gym or running!).  The iPod Nano will display album art, but the screen is a bit on the small side... I made my own album images for my songs (300x300, so you see them well, easily found on the Internet by searching Google Images) and associated them with my music in iTunes.  When you load the songs onto your iPod, the images automatically go with them.#3: Cost - Comparatively speaking, $249 for a 4Gb MP3 player is STEEP, considering what the unit delivers and the sparse included accessories.  When you go out and buy a protective case and other necessary items, like a USB POWER ADAPTER so you can charge the iPod when not connected to a computer (yep, can you believe they don't give you this?), a DOCK (they give you the CABLE only!), and upgraded headphones (if you find the earbuds annoying), the cost will add up to quite a hefty sum if you buy the accessories from Apple.  I've found good non-OEM accessory makers out there (check closely on auction websites), so you can definitely do better.#4: Sound quality - Overall, it's very good (depending on your environment, sound file quality, and ear sensitivity).  Most MP3 players do not send relatively much power to the headphone jacks, so they give you cheap ones to mask this.  The default earbuds with the Nano are OK--certainly good enough for a workout session in a noisy gym.  But if you're an audiophile and require top grade sound all the time, you may be disappointed.  I recommend testing out the Nano in the Apple store with your own preferred earbuds/headphones to judge for yourself.  I bought a nice set of over-the-ear headphones that the Nano drives reasonably well.  I am considering getting a portable headphone amplifier for long trips, though.#5: File management - you have to use iTunes to get songs onto your iPod.  That's ok--iTunes is a decent music management program.  However, it works seamlessly ONLY if you use Apple's proprietary AAC encoding.  This will take all of your MP3 files and convert them to AAC, then load them into the iTunes library.  The file size is a little smaller, but the sound quality is not consistently good.  To convert files back to MP3 format, you'll find a noticeable sound quality loss.  Personally, I REFUSE to lose music portability and so I'm sticking with MP3 format.  In order to do this, you have to sacrifice the iTunes synchronization feature.  I think this may also explain why when copying songs onto my iPod via playlists, I end up getting duplicate songs--the iPod does not seem to know how to link an incoming playlist to songs that may already be on the iPod.  Very annoying.  I find I have to periodically clear my Nano and completely reload.  But that's OK--even with the 4Gb Nano, it's not a very long time to reload it.#6: Battery life - I have to say that this is the first device I've had that has a very even power meter display.  Most of the time battery powered devices (like cell phones) will indicate a full charge for a long time and then drop off quickly.  The Nano power meter diminishes very evenly.  In fact, when the meter hits the \"red\" zone, your iPod can go for another 3-4 hours.  I conducted my own power test--I fully loaded the Nano and let it play from a full charge.  At the end of 12 hours, it was done.  Ok, not the 14 hours that Apple claims, but close enough.  Keep in mind, this was undisturbed playing and at 3/4 volume level.  The backlight of the Nano takes up a lot of power, so I keep mine set to a 2 second shut off (the default is 10 seconds).ACCESSORIES:  If you plan to use the Nano for working out, I recommend getting a case that will allow you to strap it to your arm.  I bought a silicone-gel kind of case for the nano that has openings in the back for a velcro strap.  Works great!  Definitely get a wall charger (so you can charge the Nano independently of your computer).  And if you want to use your iPod with a stereo system or to have it propped up nicely on your desk, get a docking station.  I have a friend that bought a car FM transmitter for the iPod so he can play it through his stereo--it works pretty well.I really do like the Nano.  But I have to admit that I have a few grudges:  the tiny 1.5\" screen (I think 2\" should have been possible), the lack of a brightness control (the Nano becomes a flashlight in the dark it is so bright--unnecessary, as I'd rather save the power), tiny storage for what you get (an 8Gb chip should fit in this form factor), and lack of built-in features like FM receiver and direct memory card file transfers.  I bought my Nano primary for exercise, with the intention of getting a larger PMP (portable media player) for storing my complete collection of music as well as favorite photos.  It's important to set aside the Nano \"coolness\" factor and really look at this device for what it should deliver on FOR THE PRICE.  If your main purpose for getting an MP3 player is to hear music during workouts, and you don't need a large library of music with you when traveling, then the Nano may appeal to you.  However, if you are ok with the standard iPod size, I recommend going with a full size iPod or a Creative Labs device (Nomad Zen or Zen Vision).TIP:  When you first get the Nano, utilize the protective film already on the front as a screen protector, by trimming it in between the screen and the click wheel (your case will protect the rest).  If you do it carefully, the film will remain nicely in place without air bubbles and will last a good long while.  Eventually, after the film acquires enough scratches, buy the screen protector film readily on the market!", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "4Gb iPod Nano is pricey, but may be worth it (read on)...", "unixReviewTime": 1133222400, "reviewTime": "11 29, 2005"}

I sold my Mini the day Nano came out. Here are my bullet point cons and prosObvious Pros (that everyone already knows)* Much smaller* Color screen. The screen is very bright and much more pleasurable to navigate around compared to Mini.Not So Obvious Pros* Robust. Because Nano uses flash memory as opposed to hard drives in regular iPod or Mini, Nano is immune to shock. I dropped it from my shoulder height while playing, and the music played as usual. And there is nothing wrong afterward* Transfer speed. Again, because of the flash memory, Nano is able to transfer files 1.5x faster than MiniCons* Very vulnerable to scratch (especially the black version). I keep the protective plastic at the front, plus a self-made paper wrap to protect it.* Expensive accessories. Speaking of protective wrap, the currently available ones are way overpriced. That is why it led me to make one from paper myself.* Incompatible accessories with Mini. Because of the removal of the extra hole near the head phone plug, many Mini accessories are incompatible with Nano. One noticeable one is Griffin iTrip (the FM transmitter). I guess accessory manufacturers will come up with more Nano accessories over time.* Slightly shorter battery life than Mini. 14 hours v.s. 18 hours (official numbers). However, I have no problem with that 4 hours difference.I like it a lot, but I have to give it a 4 stars for all the cons. I suggest you buy the 4 GB version instead of the 2 GB.

I'm using it with a 1Ghz Powerbook G4 15\" 10/10/1000 ethernet, DVI, but NOT USB 2.0...  which poses a problem because the Nano does not support sync via firewire.(although it can be charged over firewire)The lack of firewire, my only real complaint about the nano, and aside from that, there is very little to find fault in aside from an overly bright screen (see below).  I've overcome the lack of firewire compatability by upgrading my laptop to USB 2.0 through the purchase of a $24 USB 2.0 PCMCIA card from Fry's.  For about the same cost as what I would have had to pay for the firewire cable anyway (if it were useful for anything other than charging) I have a PCMCIA card that provides compatability in addition to fast USB for external hard disks, etc...  The mac (osx panther) recognized the card immediately, without the need for drivers, etc.  Sync was very very fast, transfering complete songs in less than 1 second per song in many cases.  FAST transfers.  Fry's had numerous models of cards, some with Firewire and USB 2.0, other's with just firewire, and still others with only USB.  I purchased the least expensive, USB 2.0 only card that, only on the back of the package in fine type did it mention macs... and it works almost perfectly.  (note unplug the card before closing the powerbook lid or it won't sleep, and won't wake up the monitor, forcing a restart... this is the only issue I've encountered)Regarding the Nano.  Small, stupid small, almost too small...almost.  Click wheel works great, volume is powerful, songs are accessed immediatly with no delay (flash memory).  As there is no hard disk to be scrambled from impacts, it is able to take minor drops without issue.  And when it does fall, the thing is so light that it almost always falls softly.  Syncs are very very quick using USB 2.0.  (I frequently wipe all the songs and re-upload rather than poke through them when I want to make changes.  Uploading about 3 gigs of music takes around 30-40 seconds at most)The unit is light weight enough that I often pick it up by the headphone cord with no fear of it unplugging and falling.  The stock earbuds sound great, but hurt my ears after extended listening.  I currently use some foam earbuds I already owned.  Others have no problems with the ear buds, so I think it's just dependant upon the shape of one's ears.My only other complaint and I'm sure it can be overcome with a firmware upgrade, is that the white LED back light is blindingly bright at night.  When in the car using it, it actually almost hurts to look at it.  When the back light turns off, it does so by quickly fading out, so the capability to vary brightness is there, and needs to only have a menu option added to control it for low light use.  If I had to think up anything else wrong, I would say it the black moel shows fingerprints and smudges too easily. (but it looks sooo good in black)... but really, disregarding the lack of firewire which I'm sure would have added size, and since mose people already have USB 2.0 anyway could afford to be sacrificed...

At home, we have five, including this one: the 4GB iPod nano black.Before you leap, realize two things: (1) this iPod is extremely fragile compared to other iPods, particularly the tough-as-nails iPod mini (a drop of a couple of feet onto a linoleum floor took out the screen); and (2) the black version gets scratched very easily, and shows scratches far more than any white iPod I've owned (after a day and before dropping the damn thing, it already looked awful from scratching -- and it was treated with kid gloves).Okay, if you can live with those caveats, and invest in a durable protector (we bought the arm-band holder, which does a lousy job of protecting the iPod nano)--none of which are out yet--then this new iPod is truly an amazing bit of technology.

I read the reviews and did as much research as possible and then waited for it to come on the market. It's truly one of the best purchases I've ever made. It's also a purchase where I feel I got a true \"Bang For My Buck!\"Apple produced another wonder in the electronic marketplace. You might be buying this for yourself or thinking of buying it for someone that you Really, Really care about.

It also happens to come from someone who never really cared for Apple computers, however I'd be crazy to let my computer preference get in the way of an awesome and affordable product-the Apple iPOD 4 GB Nano! I've grown to really appreciate Apple computers and the iPOD 4 GB Nano takes my relationship to a whole new level.There is plenty of information available to you in regard to the specifications of the new iPOD. You can simply go to GOOGLE and find thousands of bits and pieces of information that will be helpful in making your purchase, but I think it's sometimes beneficial to hear from someone who HAS the product and wants to share his/her own personal experience with it. Please remember to always take all the time you need to make your purchase, whether it is for yourself or if you're purchasing it as a gift. I just can't imagine how excited someone would be to open a package and find an APPLE iPOD 4 GB Nano wrapped inside the bubble packaging!You'll learn all about the 1000 Songs it can store and play, along with it's ability to play a musical slideshow with up to 25,000 photos! Doesn't that ALONE sound incredible? It can store thousands of contact information and even act as a stopwatch or world clock. The display is beyond what I ever imagined in something this size. You'll soon learn that you can organize all of your music by several different categories. For example, mine has a category for easy listening music that I enjoy listening to and I can even separate the easy listening music by artist or album.There are too many features to mention. As I'm trying to conclude this review I keep getting bombarded, in my mind, with additional features like the great games that are included.

I hooked up the iPod before installing the iPod software. Big no-no.

It is approximately 1 ounce in weight, so almost unnoticable on your person - whether it's in a pocket or an armband. The small color screen is stunningly brilliant in brightness and color definition.The black iPod shows fingerprints more prominently than the white version - but ooh la la, it is most sexilicious to look at! I'd personally love to see one of these in red as well.Because they are so new, third party vendors haven't had much of a chance to make cases and other products for the Nano.There are only a handful of already existing products out there that are already compatible with the Nano...Available FM Transmitters:Forget the iTrip and those of that ilk - current versions won't work with the Nano. Your choices for now are the Belkin (which is buggy) and the Monster iCar Play Plus. The Monster version isn't cheap, but it's an integrated charger and FM transmitter and is one of the best out there.Available Cases:The Apple branded armband - looks like a glorified bandaid in the case, but looks decent when you wear itApple branded Tubes - good luck finding one, most Apple Stores still haven't gotten any in stockApple branded iPod Socks - designed for the older iPods, they work fine with the Nano - but can cause minor scratchesAvailable Speakers that Charge:The JBL OnStage - fits fine, sounds greatThe Bose Sound Dock - is visibly off-center, but fits fine, sounds freakin' awesomeAltec Lancing's IM3 for full and mini - fits but sound is lacklusterKlipsch - sounds great... Nano is greatly dwarfed, however by such large equipment... akin to building a superdome around a book of matches.By the time you read this review, 10 other vendors will have probably already submitted their patents and copyrights to lawyers for new gizmos.Apple has announced that the new configuration of how the Nano connection is set up will be the NEW standard for all forthcoming iPods... this will help vendors make products more quickly and without quaking in their boots that by the time they get something to market, it will be outdated - and should encourage lots of new development like we have yet to have seen thus far in the iPod accessory industry.The Nano adds a World Clock, a stop watch and a combination lock to the \"extras\" menu. The famous silver back collects scratches and fingerprints exactly like its counterparts - but this is a known - get a case to protect your investment. Contrary to what another reviewer posted, the Nano is not \"fragile\" - far from it. There are no moving parts - so you could probably use this as a hacky-sack for an hour without fazing it.At least one consumer has published their own abuse study of the Nano, running it over with a car and throwing it from a moving car at 55mph before finally rendering it useless after a 40 foot drop onto cement. The screen makes it a tad more vulnerable than the shuffle... but it's a sturdy piece of industrial art.My less than perfect rating is for the following:1.) No firewire support - even if you have a dock connector to firewire cable, you won't be able to use it - it is USB 2.0 only. What is Apple thinking? Hello! Remember your loyal Mac users who prefer FireWire?2.) Sole earphone jack is too close to dock connector - using a splitter probably precludes charging it at the same time.3.) No extra jack or connector on flipside so remote can be added while it charges... so if and when the vendors make recorders, remotes and other goodies for the Nano, you won't be able to use them in tandem with a charging solution.4.) No bluetooth. Why is this an issue? More and more items are becoming BT enabled. One application I can think of right now is a Nano finder. The Nano is almost weightless and very thin - if you misplace it, how are you going to find it? If it had BT and you had (for example) a Nano finder on a keychain, clicking it could send a signal to your Nano to make audible clicks. Just an idea. This review loses a star for the other reasons, however, not this one... but come on, Apple!5.)Still no way to get custom logo engraving via Apple unless you're a corporation with a large order... third party vendors are now doing laser engraving so you can put photos of pets, kids, yourself, your logo, etc. on the back of your iPod - but Apple offers no such solution. Considering that stamps.com allows you to make your own legal US postage with a photo of your pet, and they are able to prevent porn and other objectionable imagery through, there is no reason why Apple cannot make this accommodation.6.) Limited (still!) photo capabilites. Compact Flash cards are like diamonds - the bigger they are, the more they are per carat (or rather, per MB). The iPod Photo camera connector connects a camera just fine - but not to the Nano! There is no explanation for this - it still uses a dock connector, but won't work w/ the Nano. The camera connector isn't that great to begin with, because you can ONLY use it to connect an iPod to a camera, not to a compact flash or multi reader... so if you're out in the field taking photos, you can't take them until your photos download and you waste your battery in your camera. If you could attach a card reader to the connector and download photos for storage on your iPod while simultaneously shooting more photos with your camera using a different card so you can swap without losing precious shooting time. Camera connector shortcomings notwithstanding, it doesn't work with the Nano.

I do like it, though, and I've had it now about three months.Like many of the other reviewers have noted, it does scratch easily, the battery life is maybe half of what is advertised, it's hard to get the connector out while the phones are plugged in, and the ear buds are uncomfortable bordering on painful.There is one other glitch that I find annoying. I frequently use the \"hold\" switch so that it won't turn on accidentally and start playing when I'm not using it. However, if you plug it into the connector while the hold switch is on, the unit turns on and locks up. The screen light is on, the last song played is displayed and paused, and no amount of clicking or turning on and off will get it to unlock. The only thing you can do is let the battery run completely down and recharge, which takes many hours. I'd love to know if anyone else has encountered this problem. I guess remembering to switch off \"hold\" would help, but I don't always remember.With all those problems you'd think I would hate it but I really do like it. On the plus side, the Nano is unbelievably lightweight and compact. The display is bright and easy to read and the sound is great. The wheel is simplicity itself and an amazing engineerig feat.

It was still working fine but I was beginning to run into many of its limitations: poor battery life, slow shot-to-shot performance, inability to focus in dim conditions, noisy images at high ISO and/or long shutter speeds, SmartMedia memory cards limited to 128 MB and etc.The D50 has none of these problems.  I took a couple hundred pictures over the Christmas holiday (with frequent use of the flash) and never had to charge the battery.  The D50 has a high-speed, ~3 frame-per-second mode and can take pictures as fast as you'd like.I purchased the 18-70 DX lens instead of the 18-55 lens that normally comes with the D50.  With this combination it rarely has trouble focusing.  And even if it's a little off, you can manually fine-tune the focus after the autofocus has given it its best shot.  It is so nice to have a true, optical, through-the-lens viewfinder.  I often had parallax errors with the viewfinder in my old P&S.;I'm also a huge fan of the D50's low noise at high ISO settings.  I can shoot at 1600 ISO in dim conditions with about the same level of noise as my old camera has at 100 ISO.If you think you've grown out of your P&S; digicam, go ahead and get a D-SLR.  The performance is so much better and it will make you want to start taking pictures again.  And unlike point and shoots, megapixels don't matter as much with a D-SLR.  Take the Canon 20D, for example.  It is an 8-megapixel camera (vs the D50's 6-megapixels).  While it sounds like a lot more, in reality you'll only be able to make a print that's about 2 inches wider (and the D50 makes beautiful 8x10s).Get one.

This camera is well-built and even with \"only\" 6 megapixels, it'll still blow away most modern point-and-shoot cameras.The key feature that the D50 has that NONE of the entry-level Nikons (ie &lt;$1000) have had since is the \"drive screw\".  What is it?  Basically, it's a feature that allows this camera to autofocus lenses that don't have a focus motor built into the lens itself.  On Nikon lenses, this is AF vs. AF-S.  The AF lenses need the screw drive to work, whereas the AF-s lenses have the motor built in.  One key lens is the Nikon 50mm f1.8 AF lens.  It's a superb value lens that can be had under $100.  Having the drive screw also opens up lens options from Sigma, Tamron, and other 3rd-parties and these lenses are often much cheaper as well.Therefore, if you're hesitant about buying a DSLR because of the price, or you're not sure of which brand you want to commit to, try out a used D50, get a couple of these cheaper lenses, and you'll have a great kit for probably less than you'd spend on one of the newer entry-level DSLR's.Where you will find this camera lacking compared to other more modern replacements is in continuous shooting speed, no SDHC capability, and poorer high-ISO (>800) performance.  However, my advice is to learn how to use a DSLR and hone your technique with something inexpensive but still versatile, then you can determine which of those attributes are actually important when considering your next purchase.Finding a good deal on a used D50 is a no-brainer!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "The best buy in older/value Nikon DSLR's", "unixReviewTime": 1288051200, "reviewTime": "10 26, 2010"}

Images are excellent, of course. But the thing that most impresses me is how fast this camera is in every way that matters. When you turn it on, it's ready to shoot--no perceptible warm-up. When you press the shutter release, it shoots right then--not half a second later like many digital cameras, which miss critical shots. You can shoot in rapid sequence--no waiting around for it to process the last shot. It focuses fast, too. Spring for the extra money for a high-speed SD card and you'll get screaming transfer times, too.The only complaint I have is the little rubber cover that hides the USB and other ports is a little hard to get smoothly all the way back into place. A pretty minor complaint.An unexpected bonus compared to all the little digital point-and-shoot cameras I've used is the D50 has a 3:2 aspect ratio instead of 4:3.

Yes, it has being replaced by the Nikon D40(x) line. However, take this into consideration; when it comes to Single-Lens-Reflex systems, one main component that matters most is the quality of the lens, and the versatility of the body to handle the lens.The Nikon D40 just don't have that ability auto-focus with legacy lenses unless they have intergraded, coreless focus motor build-in (AF-I or AF-S). Think of it this way, the next Nikon model that presently has the ability to use this old legacy of lens is the Nikon D80 (making it and advanced feature).These lens have an established reputation of being durable, tack sharp, versatile, and all around excellent optics. Although I don't believe that film SLR will be obsolete anytime soon, the growth of DSRL and compatible DX lenses will take away some of the demands for these old lenses, providing you with bargain prices, such as the standard 50mm f1.8 which you can get for about $100. This lens one of the best you can ever get for your Nikon digital or film and although fully-functional on the Nikon D50, I will not auto focus on D40(x)).In conclusion, I believe that if you buy the Nikon D40, and you improved as a photographer, you may feel necessary to upgrade to a more advanced body. If you get a Nikon D50, your focus will be on new lenses. Personally, the ideal starter kit is: Nikon D50, 2G fast SD card, Sigma 10-20mm, Nikon 18-200 VR f3.5-5.6, the Nikon 50mm f1.8 to compensate low light conditions due to the wonderful f1.8, and a Nikon SB-600 flashlight.Beware, the SLR system of photography is highly addictive, and you will be tented to purchase a great amount of accessories to complement your system.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Get one before they are all gone!!", "unixReviewTime": 1176422400, "reviewTime": "04 13, 2007"}

When the D50 came out, accompanied with fantastic reviews in the digital photo magazines, I finally took the plunge.This is a GREAT camera.  Really versatile, and terrific image quality.6 megapixels is, as I understand it, the digital equivalent of a 35mm film resolution.  Be sure, though, to keep the ISO setting as low as possible.  Just as shooting 800ASA film will introduce more grain to your film shots, even shooting 400ISO will introduce much unwanted video noise to your digital shots.Battery life is amazing.  I recently had a 14 hour shoot, in which I shot over 1500 frames.  I planned ahead and bought a spare battery -- only, I never needed it!  I've used the camera often since the beginning of the year -- the battery charge indicator has remained on 'full' since my last charge, around Christmas.The most important issue with any camera, though, is image quality.  This baby exceeds all expectations.  As a point-and-shoot (full auto mode), it's phenominal.  Start messing with the myriad of available settings, and you can do anything with it.In full auto mode, I recommend killing the flash in all but the most necessary situations (nighttime parties, for example -- you've got no other choice).All in all, this is a brilliant, wonderful, exceptional camera.One final note -- piece of advice I heard often as I was doing my research:If you already have a film-based SLR camera, be sure to check out the digital SLRs made by your film camera's manufacturer.  If you have Nikon already, the D50 is great and you can probably use most if not all of your existing lenses on this body.

I scoured magazine and online reviews and the choice came down to the Canon EOS Rebel XT and the Nikon D70.They are very similar.  The EOS is 8.0 MP vs. the D70's 6.1 MP but for the type of photography I will be doing (max 11x14 prints) that is not a problem.  The D70 has quite a few more control features.  That and the price difference tipped me towards the Nikon.Once I made up my mind to buy a Nikon, I compared the D70 to the D50.  They are quite similar and in some ways the D50 is superior to the more expensive D70.  Besides a more rugged body, the D70 has a few nice features the D50 lacks: a lighted control panel, a front sub-control thumbwheel, depth of field preview, and you can fine-tune white balance.  But the D50 has some features over the D70, notable a larger LCD monitor, higher capacity battery, and USB 2.0 high speed support.  Every magazine I read raved about the D50 and none of the features it lacked made me willing to pay more for the D70.  I purchased the D50 with the Nikkor AF-S DX 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G Zoom Lens.After using it for several weeks all I can say is, wow!  It is easy to use but I can fiddle with nearly all settings when I want to get creative.  Using a digital with almost no shutter lag has spoiled me.  I've taken many great shots with a Canon PowerShot 1S IS but it's my backup now.  In the D50 I have finally found an affordable digital camera that is as fun to use as my film cameras.Pros will probably prefer higher-end Nikons but if you like using film SLRs and would like to get into a D-SLR for less than the price of a decent used car, I highly recommend the D50.June 2006 update: I recently used my D-50 to photograph friends doing a triathlon to raise money for cancer research.  It performed flawlessly in all settings and I ended up with many outstanding photos.  The triathlon gave me ample opportunities to use the D-50's \"sports\" setting and continuous exposure feature to capture athletes swimming, bicycling, and running from a variety of distances.  The colors are perfect and I was able to get 5x7 and 8x10 prints on photo paper (from a lab) with hardly a tweak beyond cropping.  The D-50 is now my favorite camera.  Yes, there are cameras with higher resolution and more features but it is hard to beat the \"bang for the buck\" factor on the D-50.One suggestion: like every other camera manual I have ever read, the Nikon manual that comes with the D-50 is accurate and complete but leaves a lot to be desired.  Unless you are so experienced that you do not have to read a manual (and I'm not) I highly recommend you invest in a copy \"Magic Lantern Guides: Nikon D50\" by Simon Stafford.  This book is everything the Nikon manual is not.  This Magic Lantern Guide not only thoroughly explains every feature on the D-50 but goes beyond to illustrate how, when, and why you would use a setting or feature.  It also throws in tips & tricks that Nikon's writers wouldn't include.

Feldman \"Technophile\"", "helpful": [37, 37], "reviewText": "Growing up in the 70s and 80s as a photo enthusiast I had a succession of Nikon SLRs and lenses and was deeply devoted to them.  In the late 90s and early 2000s I was seduced by the ability to manipulate and quickly print digital pictures and had a succession of digital cameras including an Olympus D490z and a Canon G3.  These cameras had their charms, but they were slow to shoot - often missing the action.  Their dynamic range (ability to capture detail in both shadow and highlight areas) paled beside good film.  Also, their lightweight manual override modes and lenses made them poor competition to the Nikons for nighttime, macro, and special lighting photography.  I purchased a Nikon D50 almost as an impulse when I saw the price - and was prepared to be disappointed.  For the most part I was thrilled.What's hot:1) This camera is FAST.  Just like my film SLR, the camera is instantly on when I turn it on and shoots as fast as my finger drops (except when the flash is involved - just like my SLR).  I finally get action shots of the kids!  Yipeee!  This feature alone totally sold my wife on this camera.2) Autofocus is awesome - seems to have ESP when picking subjects.  Has quick and easy target selection override.3) Great dynamic range and resolution.  Shooting in fine jpeg mode allows me to print in whatever size I like - up to 8x10 without obvious artifacts.  Tones are smooth without visible plateaus most of the time and have good detail in both shadow and bright areas.4) Great flexibility.  A wealth of modes gives me shortcuts to operational modes that handle a wealth of special sitation photography.  Manual overrides give me amazing control.5) Good (but not perfect) meter.6) Small and extremely light weight for an SLR.7) 18-55mm lens has good wide angle range, somewhat limited telephoto - but covers all the basics with aplomb.  I seldom want for more.8) Great macro mode in the built-in camera.  Nikon has purpose-built macro lenses, but the macro in the standard 18-55 is way better than the G3's $85 macro add-on solution.  Images of coins fill the frame and you can see tiny detail.  Way more than adequate for selling coins or stamps on Ebay.9) I find this camera very attractive10) Integrated help screens in many of the menus.  This camera is deep.  You will not get the most out of it unless you take the time to learn about it.  Once you have the gist - the help screens help you remember what's up when you're out in the field.NOTs1) I can't use my old Nikon AI lenses.  They fit - but don't communicate with the meter.2) Superlightweight for the size - will it be durable?3) It may be lightweight for the size - but this is still an SLR and can't compete with smaller cameras for portability.  This doesn't fit in any pockets - it hangs around your neck or lives in a kit bag.4) Doesn't have a \"B\" mode on shutter release - limiting its use for astrophotography.  This is too bad because it's so light.5) 18-55mm lens isn't as cool as the 18-70mm lens the D70S ships with.  Oh well - the 18-55 is still mighty fine for the price.  If you have more scratch buy the D50 body and get the 18-70 ala cart.6) This a serious camera for photo enthusiasts.  While the awesome speed and image quality in full auto mode makes it easy for beginners to get started, a point and shoot user is going to to frustrated by this camera because the magic requires a half hour with the manual and some basic photo knowledge.7) 2\" screen on the back is fixed - it's more for settings and looking at pictures after you shoot than for shooting.  You shoot while looking through the viewfinder on this camera.  This fits the whole SLR ethos.  I sometimes miss the cool articulated screen with the G3 that let me hold the camera at arm's length - like low to the ground or high in the air to get cool \"point of view\" shots.  That's right out with the D50.8) Secure Digital Media - a strength or weakness depending on your perspective.  Most other DSLRs use compact flash and I'm selling my nice collection of compact flash cards on Ebay right now.Bottom line?  After 25 years I'm finally selling my Nikon FA (and all my darkroom equipment).  The D50 is so good that I'm putting film to bed at last.  The shooting experience with the D50 is as good as film in most areas and better in some others.  The fact that you can bring this home for under eight bills is gravy.  This price, by the way is pretty much exactly what the film SLRs ended up costing in adjusted dollars.  Kudos to Nikon for leapfrogging Canon with the killer entry level DSLR.

I started with an N6006 and also still have the N70. In '02 I went digital with a small Canon S30 P&S.; That camera got me a lot of great pictures, but I'd take out the N70 every now and then because it took so much better pictures.  Digital, however, is just so much more convenient to use now a days.I always longed for a dSLR ever since Nikon launched their first back around 1999-2000. Those were the $5000 units. One day, the price would come down. They then came out with the D100. Still out of my price range. The D70 and D70s started to make my dSLR dreams more real. After the D50 was launched, I was still convienced that the D70s was the way to go.  Then I started reading reviews. The D50, although considered \"An entry level\" camera, was nothing to take lightly. The more I looked into it the more I realized that maybe the D50 was for me. I didn't really need a lot of the 'bells and whistles' of the D70s. It has the same sensor (which is better than the D70 and D100), the D50 only goes to 1/4000th of sec instead of 1/8000th of sec (but how many pictures of hummingbirds do we really take?), command dials: 1 vs 2 - my film camera's only had 1 I wont miss the other, same for the DOF preview and backlit LCD, plus the info that is there can also been seen in the viewfinder.  If you want a DOF preview, take the picture and look at it in the 2\" LCD. Those extra things weren't worth $300 to me, especially for the same amount of mexapixels, 6.1.I've had the D50 for a little more than 6 months now. In addition to the camera I bought the Nikkor 18-70mm lens (I wanted a bit more reach than the 18-55mm). This compliments my old Quantaray 70-300mm telephoto zoom lens I used with my N70. I also purchased the Nikkor 50mm f/1.8, which is worth its weight in gold. Outstanding pictures and its inexpensive at just over 100 dollars.I've taken about 2500 pictures thus far, including a 4 day photo trip to Walt Disney World. This camera does not disapoint. I haven't used any of the preset settings. I use P, S, A or M only. AFAIC, this is an SLR camera, not a point and shoot.This camera has brought me back into photography as a hobby. Everything I learned in high school and then forgot, I've now picked up again and the results are outstanding.If you do get this camera or already have it, do yourself a favor and learn about lighting. Learn how shutter speeds and aperture and ISO affect your pictures. Once you get the hang of it you will only improve your pictures.Also keep in mind, that this is really only a light tight box and the pictures you take with it are more influenced by the lens you have on it.  This makes this camera even better in that it is less expensive and will allow you to get better lenses (ie: 18-70mm, 50mm f/1.8, or if you really want supurb results: 17-55 f/2.8, 35-70 f/2.8, 105mm f/2.8 VR macro and the big daddy,,, 70-200mm f/2.8 VR)The beauty of SLR's are the interchangeable lenses. There will always be a lens you'll want next.  The beauty of digital SLR's, they record all the information along with the image, ie: shutter speed, f/stop, ISO, white balance, lens used, date/time, focal length used, if flash was fired and more. This information, if you use it, will improve your photography skills. No need for bringing along a notebook. Digital is your friend!!Enjoy.

Compared to the competition (which you can read about all you want on the wider web), it offers an excellent feature set at an excellent price point. If low cost was your only concern, you can't really go wrong with the D50. It is an excellent camera, but make no mistake, it is not as capable as Nikon's other offerings. It is also worth remembering that no camera will take pictures for you; you can take astounding pictures with any camera, either astoundingly good, or astoundingly bad. The important feature of any camera is that your camera does not get in the way of your photography, but again, it is your photography, not the camera, that takes good pictures.If you are shopping for a D50, I strongly encourage you to consider the D70: it has more features and the same basic usability as the D50, and the cost is pretty much the same. The D70s is more expensive, but has a couple of newer features than the D70; as far as taking pictures goes, the D70 and D70s are pretty much the same camera.Why the D70? Two main reasons. One is the kit lens (18-70mm) that comes with the D70 kit package. The 18-55mm lens that ships with the D50 kit is a lower-end lens (note that I'm not calling it a bad lens), but the 18-70 lens that comes in the D70 kit is an excellent lens. You may quickly feel limited by the D50 kit lens, but the D70 kit lens is good enough that you would not feel ashamed if you were using it on Nikon's flagship camera, the D2x.The second reason to go with the D70 is that it leaves more doors open if you want to upgrade later on. It supports more of the high-end functions of the more expensive Nikon digital SLRs (such as the wireless flash capabilities of Nikon's iTTL system), and it uses CompactFlash memory cards-- if you do decide to upgrade, you won't have to buy a whole new set of memory cards. The memory card business is a minor consideration, but if you're a starving artist trying to scrimp together the money to upgrade, a couple hundred bucks can make a difference. After all, that's part of why you're looking at the D50, right?Think of the extra $50-100 you spend on a D70 as an investment in your new hobby. It's not as important if you plan on buying a new camera body every year, but for those of us that plan on using the camera for several years, the versatility is more than worth the price.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good for beginners", "unixReviewTime": 1126137600, "reviewTime": "09 8, 2005"}

The construction isn't as solid as N90 (bullet-proof), but it's pretty close.  After using this camera for almost 3 weeks, I've fallen back in love with photography.  Not only am I excited to take photos, but I am also interested in experimenting given there are no development costs!The only weakness of this camera (for me), is lack of backlit LCD.  When in a dark situation, you may encounter a problem.  (Not yet though).  Some people say CF is better, but because my other camera uses SD, I'm very happy with Nikon's decision.  You can pickup a 1 gig SD card on sale for $30 now.Summary:I told my friends that when there's a good DSLR for $500, I will buy it., and so I have.  And after owning this camera for 3 weeks, this is unbelievable for the price!  This is essentially a slightly stripped down D70s.  Yes, there are some nicer features on D70s, but quite frankly I can live without them.  And since I never had them (grid lines, depth of field preview), I don't think I'll even miss them.SLRs:I noticed some users complaining about lack of comprehending about SLR.  All SLR manuals are only sufficient to get you through the controls of the camera.  SLRs are not point and shoot and nobody will explain about details of how to take a picture.  In the old days, classes were highly recommended.  But with DSLR, you have no excuse but to blast through hundreds of photos to figure out what is the best way to take a photo.  About the only thing you need is a notebook to keep track of what settings you did and describe the conditions around you.  Though I own and watched N90 video (in the mid 90's) I found this wonderful site:[...]Let the flash load completely, and click on \"Open Menu\" and Nikon will guide you through the basics.  If you go through the entire tutorial, I think it's the equivalent of video tutorial you can buy from them..  (I have not seen the D50 video but that's pretty much what N90 video tutorial covered.).Conclusion:This camera has brought back the joy of photography for me.  I am looking forward to taking many memorable pictures with my D50.  I would strongly recommend anybody who wants to take great pictures and are willing to spend time to learn about SLR, this is the camera for you.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I've fallen in love with photography all over again!", "unixReviewTime": 1143158400, "reviewTime": "03 24, 2006"}

I was an avid film SLR (Minolta XG1) user until I bought this camera.  After extensive research, I finially purchased a D50.  Over one year later, and over 15,000 shots, I couldn't be happier.  The pictures are just amazing.  The camera is quick and does what you want it to do.  If you are a point and shooter, or someone who does not like to make adjustments for the optimal picture, this camera is not for you.  I believe that most people's problems come from lack of experience, bad lens, or in rare situations, a bad camera.  You must have patience with this camera to get the best out of your pictures.PROS::::*Sharp, sharp, sharp - always depends on your lens - I shoot with a Nikon 18-200 VR, and even get wonderful pictures off of a Sigma 70-300*Instant start up*Instant pictures - press the button and picture is taken immediately*All of the manual control you could want*Great autofocus and metering, once you learn how to use it - I shoot in Aperture priority with autofocus*Great pictures stright out of the camera - I rarely post-process*SD cards - I love the small size and quick write and read speed.  Plus the price keeps dropping*Nice LCD - large, and gives an idea of what the photo looks like, but do not trust it (as with any LCD)*Absolutely amazing battery life - I have taken over 300 pictures (without flash) with the battery still reading at full strengthCONS::::*Not ideal for indoor/very low light situations.  Bad noise at high ISO, and poor built in flash*No light on the top LCD screen*I don't really care for the \"dummy\" scene modes - this just may be due to the fact that I haven't used them extensively*It was hard to get used to the small viewfinder when compared to film viewfinders.  But I did eventually get used to it*May be too small for big handsWith the low light problems, I am looking into a Fuji F30, since most of my low light pictures is with friends and I don't want to carry around a bulky DSLR!Overall, I couldn't be happier!  It may be cheaper than most of the other DSLR's, but the power lays in the lens and the photographer.  It is an awesome camera that I have learned so much from.

But it isn't my first SLR ... I have used a Canon Elan IIE for a number of years, and trust me, that camera is no slouch.But enough about me ... the D50 is the real star of the show!  I have had the camera (along with the standard lens included with the kit) and so far I am extremely happy.  I purchased it just in time to capture some photos of my new neice, and my family swears that the pictures that I was just casually snapping at the hospital look like they are professional portaits.  Granted, some of my family members ... well, their necks are pretty tan, if you know what I mean, but you get the point.  The camera has a slew of modes that are ideally suited to your subject (portraits, action, etc etc), and they do a great job of making all of the fine adjustments that improve the overall quality of the photo for the non-experts.  But this camera has varying levels of automation to where you would practically require a photography degree to get your picture.  My skills are somewhere in between, but trust me, if you are an absolutely beginner, in 5 minutes you can be taking photos that are 99% of the quality that a pro with a $5000 setup would take.  Now you might need to snap a few dozen shots to get just one that is amazing, but that is what is just wonderful about digital cameras.  And with a huge, super sharp LCD preview window, you can see in an instant if you have a decent shot, and if not, delete it and try again!The camera takes the small \"big-toenail\" SD memory cards, which is a departure from what you will typically see in a digital SLR.  I personally like the smaller size; otherwise, I don't believe there is a significant difference.  If you pick up one major point from this review ... READ THIS !!!!  I initially tried shooting with some SD memory that I had been using in my MP3 player.  It worked fine, but if shooting a series of rapid shots, it would take the camera what seemed like a couple of seconds to write to the memory.  That is typical with all of the digital SLRs that I have read about ... you get maybe a dozen high-speed shots, and then the camera sort of \"bogs down\".  And most of the time that is fine.  But this camera takes advantage of the slightly more expensive \"pro\" SD memory, which can be written to at extremely high speeds.  Because of this, the camera can take an unprecendented number of shots (I believe 137 according to Nikon)!!!  Folks, that is amazing, let me tell you.  You can just hold the button down and fire away, and capture all of the high-speed action that you can imagine.  No more excuses for missing that perfect action shot.  Sure, you aren't going to require this feature very often, but it is nice to have, just in case.  And even with normal shots, the high-speed memory seems to work much quicker than normal memory.The camera can save files in three different size (resolution) levels, three different JPEG quality levels, and the complete uncompressed RAW format.  I've been shooting using the medium resolution and medium JPEG quality, and the photos look sharper than my old Canon 35mm SLR.  You could easily print out 8 x 10 photos and they would look perfect even at the medium quality setting; poster size would look fine at the high quality setting.The rechargeable battery that is included is simply amazing - I believe they rate it for 2000 shots, and I believe it.  It would be VERY diffult to drain this battery in a single day, even with numerous flashes and auto-focusing shots.The fast auto-focus, very user-friendly menus, flexibility with all Nikon lenses, and near-pro quality at a price that the weekend-photo-warrior consumer can afford, I don't see how you can go wrong with this camera.Happy photographing!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fantastic digital SLR at any price!", "unixReviewTime": 1121731200, "reviewTime": "07 19, 2005"}

With the D50, over 90% of the photos don't need any help from Elements.The final verdict was comparing prints from the Kodak Print Service. I never noticed until I got the D50, but the Coolpix 5700 photos seem almost blurry in comparison to the D50 photos. The D50 photos seem somehow much clearer.

The internal software (firmware) is excellent.I had a hard time figuring out the key differences between the Nikon D70 and D50. The way I see it, the extra (aperture) wheel for the right index finger and the DOF preview button on the D70 aren't worth the price difference. One should definitely spend the extra bucks on LENSES!!! The kit lens is good enough for family and vacation snapshots but for the studio or serious photography you shoud consider getting a 30mm f=1.4, a good wide angle (zoom?) lens and some f=2.8 tele.Always remember those things that yield a good picture:1. eye of the photographer2. light, light, light !3. good photometer (to measure and evaluate light, light, light...)4. good quality lenses5. gorgeous nude modelDon't forget to buy the speediest and largest-capacity SD card available.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Solid Camera - Great Value!", "unixReviewTime": 1125878400, "reviewTime": "09 5, 2005"}

I recently upgraded from a Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ20 to the Nikon D50, and it was definitely worth the investment. Picture quality is simple wonderful. I chose the D50 over a KonicaMinolta and Canon models in large part because of the very low noise the camera produces even at high ISOs. Noise at high ISOs was a major issue with the Lumix I had previously. I also chose this over the Canon Digital Rebel XT because the Rebel is actually too small. The buttons get crammed and are easly pressed by mistake, and with a good lens (the kit lens for the Rebel isn't too spectacular) the balance of the camera is way off. Neither of these is an issue with the D50. The D50 is very quick to focus in automatic mode, controls are easy to use, shot to shot time is wonderful. Battery life, which often seems to be an issue with digital cameras, is not with the D50. My father has a Canon Digital Rebel, and claims that this camera (the D50) is nicer, and the built in flash especially impressed him. The only thing is that while the two included lenses are quite good, neither makes a good general purpose lens. The 18-55 mm is often too short, and the 55-200mm one is often too long, so you need to swap lenses a lot. That said, this being an SLR, I plan on picking up a third lens in the future that ranges from say 28 mm to 200 or 300 mm.Highly recommended camera!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Spectacular", "unixReviewTime": 1138233600, "reviewTime": "01 26, 2006"}
